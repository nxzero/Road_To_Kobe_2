\begin{abstract}
    The aim of this work is to introduce a general method, both on the numerical and the theoretical aspect, that enable us to quantify the microstructure geometry in buoyant emulsion. 
    To this end, we first have developed a novel algorithm capable of avoiding numerical coalesce for reasonable cost with volume of fluid method. 
    This enables study the statistically steady state evolution of a buoyant mono disperse suspension of nearly spherical droplets. 
    We performed parametric Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) over a wide range of \textit{Galileo} number as well as particle volume fraction and viscosity ratio. 
    By making use of the recent \textit{nearest particle statistic} framework  \citep{zhang2021ensemble,zhang2023evolution} we show that the microstructure can be described by a single tensor quantity, noted \textbf{R}, which is the second moment of the nearest particle pair distribution with respect to the relative position. 
    Then, by deriving the transport equation of \textbf{R}, we demonstrate that it is subject to a relaxation time related to the mean particles pair interaction time, noted $\tau_p$, which we could measure for all our DNS.
    Then, we make observation of the relative particle velocity fields to classify the different regime of interactions. \tb{HERE}
    Overall, our study provide a strong evidence on the impact of the latter dimensionless parameters on the  microstructure of a buoyant emulsion. 
    Especially, we show that for low viscosity ratio (bubbles-like) droplets the emulsion is more likely to form cluster and layers, and that it is more prononce with high \textit{Galileo} numbers.
    Additionally, the timescale of such interaction.

\section{Methodology}

In this section we explain the strategy adopted to carry out a statistically steady state simulation of rising mono-disperse suspension of droplets. 
We start by introducing the physical parameter, then we describe the numerical methods and lastly the methodology adopted to gather statistics is exposed.
The reader must know that the source code used to perform the DNS is entirely open source.
It is running within the \texttt{Basilisk C} framework, see \href{http://basilisk.fr}{basilisk.fr}, which is a domain-specific language of C programming language adapted for the solution of partial differential equations on adaptative Cartesian meshes. 
This section is accompanied by the wiki page : \href{http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/fintzin/Rising-Suspenion/README.md}{README.md}, were the reader can find the source code used to carry out the simulations presented in this work, as well as comments and notes to help comprehension.
