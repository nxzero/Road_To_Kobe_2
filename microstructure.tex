\begin{abstract}
    In this work we present a general analysis of the microstructure of dispersed buoyant emulsion, both on the numerical and theoretical aspects.
    % in a kinetic-theory-like framework.
    To this end, we have developed a novel algorithm capable of effectively prevents numerical coalesce between drops at reasonable computational cost.
    This algorithm is implemented within the Volume of Fluid (VoF) method, utilizing the \href{http://basilisk.fr}{http://basilisk.fr} code. 
    Subsequently, we conducted Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of statistically steady state mono-disperse buoyant emulsion, over a broad range of \textit{Galileo} number ($Ga$), particle volume fraction ($\phi$), and viscosity ratio ($\lambda$). 
    The density ratio and the \textit{Bond} number are kept constant, $\zeta = 1.11$,  $Bo = 0.2$, respectively. 
    % In \citet{zhang2023evolution}, it is demonstrated that the microstructure can be characterized effectively using the nearest particle statistic.
    % This approach relies solely on the tensor quantity, \textbf{R}, which represents the second moment of the nearest particle pair distribution.
    Then, we revisit the concept of \citet{zhang2023evolution} and show that the second moment of the nearest particle pair distribution, noted \textbf{R}, has the capability to quantify microstructure's features such as clusters and layers of particles.
    Following this, it is  demonstrated that \textbf{R} follow a kinetic theory-like conservation equation and is subject to a relaxation time $\tau_p$, which is also the average time of interaction between particles pairs. 
    After, a meticulous analysis of the averaged relative velocity fields between nearest neighbors, we could infer that mechanism such as \textit{Drafting Kissing Tumbling} \citep{fortes1987nonlinear} were present in buoyant emulsion, and that it contribute partly to the formation of the microstructure.
    % Additionally, other behavior are identified in these systems. 
    Overall, our study provide strong evidences regarding the influence of $Ga$, $\phi$ and $\lambda$ on the formation of the microstructure and on the relative kinematic of particles in buoyant emulsion. 
    In particular, our findings reveal that for low viscosity ratio ($\lambda = 1$), the emulsion is more likely to form clusters and layers with long time pairs interaction.
    In opposition to viscous particles ($\lambda = 10$), which possesses short interaction time, with a more evenly dispersed microstructure.
    The cluster and layers are amplified with high $Ga$ and moderate $\phi$.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodo}
In this section we expose the strategy employed to conduct statistically steady state simulations of rising mono-disperse suspension of droplets in a fully periodic domain. 
We start by introducing the physical parameter, followed by a description of the numerical methods.
Lastly, we detail the methodology adopted to collect statistics about microstructure, which are presented in the next sections.

The source code used to perform the DNS is entirely open source.
The simulations are running within the \texttt{Basilisk C} framework, (see \href{http://basilisk.fr}{basilisk.fr}), which is a domain-specific language of the C programming language, adapted for the solution of partial differential equations on Cartesian meshes. 
Note that this section is complemented by the wiki page, \href{http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/fintzin/Rising-Suspenion/RS.c}{RS.c}, where the reader can access the source code used to conduct the DNS, as well as comments and notes to help comprehension.
