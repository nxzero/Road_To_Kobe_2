\begin{abstract}
    In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the various  arrangements that droplets can adopt within dispersed buoyant emulsions. 
    This is termed the study of the microstructure.
    To this end, we have developed a novel algorithm capable of effectively prevents numerical coalesce between drops at reasonable computational cost.
    This algorithm is implemented within the Volume of Fluid (VoF) method, utilizing the \href{http://basilisk.fr}{http://basilisk.fr} open source code. 
    Subsequently, we conducted Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of statistically steady state mono-disperse buoyant emulsion, over a broad range of \textit{Galileo} number ($Ga$), particle volume fraction ($\phi$), and viscosity ratio ($\lambda$). 
    The density ratio and the \textit{Bond} number are kept constant, $\zeta = 1.11$ and  $Bo = 0.2$, respectively. 
    Then it is shown that, as predicted by \citet{zhang2023evolution}, the second moment of the nearest particle pair distribution, noted \textbf{R}, has the capability to quantify microstructure's features such as clusters and layers of particles.
    In particular, it is found that : 
    (1) At low $Ga$ isotropic clusters appear with increasing $\phi$. 
    (2) Non-isotropic clusters such as layers of particles, are more likely to form for high \textit{Galileo} number.
    (3) The viscosity ratio $\lambda$ has an important impact on the microstructure, clearly more layers are formed for $\lambda = 1$ than $\lambda = 10$. 
    Overall, our study provides a quantitative measure of the microstructure geometry 
     in terms of $Ga$, $\phi$ and $\lambda$.
