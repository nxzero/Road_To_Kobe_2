In this study, we analyze the various arrangements that droplets can form within dispersed buoyant emulsions, which we refer to as the study of microstructure. To this end, we have developed a novel algorithm that effectively prevents numerical coalescence between drops while maintaining a reasonable computational cost. This algorithm is integrated into the Volume of Fluid (VoF) method and implemented using the open-source code \href{http://basilisk.fr}{http://basilisk.fr}. %open source code.
    %In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the various  arrangements that droplets can adopt within dispersed buoyant emulsions. 
    %This is termed the study of the microstructure.
    %To this end, we have developed a novel algorithm capable of effectively prevents numerical coalesce between drops at reasonable computational cost.
    %This algorithm is implemented within the Volume of Fluid (VoF) method, utilizing the \href{http://basilisk.fr}{http://basilisk.fr} open source code. 
Subsequently, we perform Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of statistically steady state mono-disperse buoyant emulsion over a broad range of dimensionless parameters, including the particle volume fraction ($\phi$), the Galileo number ($Ga$) and the viscosity ratio ($\lambda$). We make use of nearest particle statistics to quantify the microstructure properties.  %\textit{Galileo} number ($Ga$), particle volume fraction ($\phi$), and viscosity ratio ($\lambda$). 
    %The density ratio and the \textit{Bond} number are kept constant, $\zeta = 1.11$ and  $Bo = 0.2$, respectively. 
%    Then it is shown that, as predicted by \citet{zhang2023evolution}, the second moment of the nearest particle pair distribution, noted \textbf{R}, has the capability to quantify microstructure's features such as clusters and layers of particles.
As predicted by \citet{zhang2023evolution}, it is demonstrated that the second moment of the nearest particle pair distribution can effectively quantify microstructural features such as particle clusters and layers. Specifically, the findings are: (1) In moderately inertial flows ($Ga=10$), droplets form isotropic clusters. In high inertial regimes ($Ga=100$), non-isotropic clusters, such as horizontal layers, are more likely to form. (3) The viscosity ratio plays a significant role in determining the microstructure, with droplets that are less viscous or equally viscous as the surrounding fluid tending to form layers preferentially. %The viscosity ratio significantly influences the microstructure, with a preferential layering formation for droplets less or equally viscous than the surrounding fluid. %with more layers forming at %λ=1\lambda = 1λ=1 compared to λ=10\lambda = 10λ=10.
%    (1) For moderately inertial flow ($Ga=10$) droplets forms isotropic clusters 
%    (2) Non-isotropic clusters such as layers of particles, are more likely to form in high inertial regimes ($Ga=100$).
%    (3) The viscosity ratio $\lambda$ has an important impact on the microstructure, clearly more layers are formed for $\lambda = 1$ than $\lambda = 10$. 
    Overall, our study provides a quantitative measure of the microstructure 
     in terms of $Ga$, $\phi$ and $\lambda$.
