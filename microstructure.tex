    In this study, we analyze the various arrangements that droplets can form within dispersed buoyant emulsions, which we refer to as the study of microstructure. 
    To this end, we have developed a novel algorithm that effectively prevents numerical coalescence between drops while maintaining a reasonable computational cost. 
    This algorithm is integrated into the Volume of Fluid (VoF) method and implemented using the open-source code \href{http://basilisk.fr}{http://basilisk.fr}. 
    Subsequently, we perform Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of statistically steady state mono-disperse buoyant emulsion over a broad range of dimensionless parameters, including the particle volume fraction ($\phi$), the Galileo number ($Ga$) and the viscosity ratio ($\lambda$). 
    We make use of nearest particle statistics to quantify the microstructure properties.  
    As predicted by \citet{zhang2023evolution}, it is demonstrated that the second moment of the nearest particle pair distribution can effectively quantify microstructural features such as particle clusters and layers. 
    Specifically, the findings are: (1) In moderately inertial flows ($Ga=10$), droplets form isotropic clusters. 
    In high inertial regimes ($Ga=100$), non-isotropic clusters, such as horizontal layers, are more likely to form. 
    (3) The viscosity ratio plays a significant role in determining the microstructure, with droplets that are less viscous or equally viscous as the surrounding fluid tending to form layers preferentially. 
    Overall, our study provides a quantitative measure of the microstructure 
     in terms of $Ga$, $\phi$ and $\lambda$.
