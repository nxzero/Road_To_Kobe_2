\section{Discussion}

In this work we provided a well-developed hybrid model that is appliable for an arbitrary dispersed two-phase flows. 
We derived it in the most general way considering volume and surface properties. 
Besides, we demonstrated the equivalence between the continuous average and particular average method by showing that the continuous averaged equations contained all the order of particular averaged equations.
