\section{Discussion}

In this work we provided a well-developed hybrid model that is appliable for an arbitrary dispersed two-phase flows. 
We derived it in the most general way considering volume and surface properties. 
Besides, we demonstrated the equivalence between the continuous average and particular average method by showing that the continuous averaged equations contained all the order of particular averaged equations. 
We ended the discussion by showing how it is straight forward to derive phenomenological equations for any kind of suspension. 
\tb{Discus the closure terms}
\tb{Insist on the flexibility of this model, it can be apply to any kind of particle nature, liquid, deformable  solid, solid etc..}
