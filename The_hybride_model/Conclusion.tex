\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}




In this work, we aimed to present a complete exposition of the averaged equations and the derivation of closures for complex dispersed phases. 
The general derivation carried from \ref{sec:local_eq} to \ref{sec:equivalence} explains in detail the structure of the system of averaged equations under the so-called hybrid formulation.  
To illustrate our approach, in \ref{sec:closure}and \ref{sec:averaged_surface} we study the example of a dilute viscous-dominated suspension of droplets, including non-uniform surface tension effects. 
We demonstrated how surface tension gradients induce a momentum source, which is responsible for the Marangoni drift of the dispersed phase, and how they also lead to non-Newtonian behavior in the momentum equations. 
Then, we determined how to calculate the averaged shape of the droplets based on the moment of momentum equations. 
An obvious perspective of this work is to use the surfaces Lagrangian-averaged equations to properly derive the transport equations for surfactant concentration (or temperature field), thereby relating surface tension gradients to physical quantities.  


On another note, there have been very few efforts to extend these results to finite Reynolds number regimes, despite the fact that most flows of interest exhibit inertial characteristics. 
\citet{stone2001inertial} demonstrated that, in the case of general linear flow, the effect of finite inertia is to produce normal stresses, leading to non-Newtonian behavior, while the effective viscosity remains unchanged with respect to Einstein's original formula. 
This prediction was extended to the case of drops by \citet{raja2010inertial}. 
However, in these works they only consider neutrally buoyant particles, hence neglecting the effects of relative motion on the suspension rheology. 
To provide a first glimpse of how inertial effects could impact the suspension rheology and droplet deformation, we need to find at least the first order correction in $\mathcal{O}(Re)$ of the closure terms in \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_Sp} and \ref{eq:dt_uf2}. 
Based on symmetry arguments (similar to those used for \ref{eq:Reynolds_stress_functional_form}) one may state that the stresslet is given by, 
\begin{equation}
    \pSavg{\textbf{r}\bm\sigma^*_f\cdot \textbf{n}}
    -\pOavg{2\mu_f\textbf{e}^*_f}
    =
    Re \phi 
    \left[
       C_s^1 \textbf{u}_{r}\textbf{u}_{r} 
    +  C_s^2 (\textbf{u}_{r}\cdot \textbf{u}_{r})\bm\delta
    \right]
    + O(Re^2,\phi^2),
    \\
\end{equation}
at the first order in Reynolds number. 
We conclude that at finite Reynolds number relative motions impact the shape balance of the particle, at least through this term (in agreement with \citet{taylor1964deformation}) and the counterpart is that it induces stresses in the suspension proportional to $\sim \textbf{u}_r\textbf{u}_r$ in addition to the contribution of the Reynolds stress \eqref{eq:Reynolds_stress_functional_form}. 
In a work in preparation we investigate the effects of drop translation at finite Reynolds numbers on the stresslet, notably we provide the exact values of the constant $C_s^{1}$ and $C_s^{2}$ (see also \citet{fintzi2025}). 
 

%Alhtough, the problem considered in the present work differs form the one encountered in processes by considreding a fixed surface tensio gradient rather than solving a transport scalr transport equation modifying locally the ssurface tension
%It is interesting to undertsnad in which cases gradient of surface tension effects becomes significant. 
%First we may note that the effect of surface tension gradient are null when the viscosity ratio is high, ie when the droplet are much more viscous thant the surrounding fluid.
%Then one may expect marangoni flows to much important for bubble than for droplets.
%In the following we will consider only the case of bubbles $\lambda =0$.
%Now we consider the case of a rising bubble in a fluid at rest with an imposed constant gradient or surface tension or equivalently an imposed gradient of species at infinity and linear relationship between the surface tension and the concentration of species.
%Equilibrating the force due to surface tension gradient to the gravity force one get and assuming moderate value of the viscosity ratio we get,  $\nabla \gamma  \sim (\rho_d -\rho) g a$ 
%Then we assume $\nabla \gamma \sim \Delta  \gamma / L$ where $\Delta  \gamma$ is the scales variation of surface tension and $L$ the lenthscale over which varies the surface tension varies. 
%Typically for an aqueous emulision ($\rho = 1000 $kg m$^{-3}$, $\mu =10^{-3}$Pa s$^{-1}$) for which $\rho_d -\rho \approx 100 $kg m$^{-3}$, typical variation of surface tension of order $\Delta  \gamma \approx 10^{-2}$N m$^{-1}$ and a typical radius $a \approx 10 \mu m$, Marangoni effects are comparable in magnitude to the weight of particle if $L \approx $1m.
%Hence we may expect significant effect of Marangoni force on the dynamics of very small bubbles even if the size over which the surface tension varies is of order of the meter.
%Now we consider the case of drop embedded in shear flow with an imposed second order spatial derivative of surface tension.
%Balancing in the effectvive stress the shear indiced viscosity term to the term orinating ftom surface tension gradient we obtain $\nabla \nabla \gamma \sim \mu \dot \gamma/a$ where $\dot \gamma$ is the typical shear rate.
%For a typical shear rate of order $\dot \gamma \approx 1 $s$^{-1}$, we get $L =1$ cm. 
%Then for processes with a local variation of surface tension of order of a few centimeter, the effective stress generated by Marangoni stress will be comparable in magnitude to that of the shear induced effective viscosity.


Although the problem considered in this work differs from that typically encountered in industrial processes-here, a fixed surface tension gradient is imposed rather than solving a scalar transport equation that governs surface tension locally-it is still insightful to understand under which conditions surface tension gradients (i.e., Marangoni effects) become significant.
First, it is worth noting that Marangoni effects become negligible when the viscosity ratio is high, meaning the dispersed phase (e.g., droplets) is much more viscous than the surrounding fluid. Consequently, one expects Marangoni flows to be more prominent for bubbles than for viscous droplets. 
%In the following, we focus on the case of bubbles, assuming a negligible viscosity ratio (\$\lambda = 0\$).
Consider a single bubble rising in a quiescent fluid under the influence of gravity and an imposed uniform surface tension gradient, or equivalently, a constant concentration gradient of a surfactant species at infinity, with a linear dependence of surface tension on concentration. 
Balancing the Marangoni force with the buoyant force gives the scaling,$\nabla \gamma \sim (\rho_d - \rho) g a$.
%where \$a\$ is the bubble radius and \$(\rho\_d - \rho)\$ is the density difference between the dispersed and continuous phases. 
Assuming the surface tension gradient scales as $\nabla \gamma \sim \Delta \gamma / L$, where $\Delta \gamma $ is the typical variation in surface tension over a characteristic length $L$, we can estimate when Marangoni effects become significant.
For instance, in an aqueous emulsion (with $\rho \approx 1000 \text{ kg/m}^3$, $\mu \approx 10^{-3} \text{ PaÂ·s}$, and $\rho_d - \rho \approx 100 \text{ kg/m}^3$), and assuming $\Delta \gamma \approx 10^{-2} \text{ N/m}$ and $a \approx 10\ \mu\text{m}$, Marangoni and buoyancy forces become comparable when $L \approx 1 \text{ m}$. 
This suggests that even when surface tension varies over meter-scale distances, Marangoni forces can significantly influence the dynamics of very small bubbles or low viscosity ratio droplets.
Next, we consider a droplet subjected to a shear flow with an imposed second-order spatial variation of surface tension. 
Balancing the effective shear stress due to the flow with the stress induced by Marangoni effects yields the scaling $\nabla^2 \gamma \sim \frac{\mu \dot{\gamma}}{a},$
where $\dot{\gamma}$ is the shear rate. 
For a typical shear rate of $\dot{\gamma} \approx 1\ \text{s}^{-1}$ and droplet size $a \approx 10\ \mu\text{m}$, the characteristic length scale over which surface tension must vary for Marangoni stresses to match shear-induced stresses is approximately $L \sim 1 \text{ cm}$.
Therefore, in processes where surface tension varies over centimeter-scale distances, Marangoni effects can generate effective stresses comparable in magnitude to those from shear-induced viscosity. 
This highlights the importance of accounting for surface tension gradients in modeling interfacial flows, particularly in systems involving small bubbles or droplets. %in sheared environments.

%    Note that in the continuous phase conservation equation \eqref{eq:avg_hybrid_dt_chi_f}, in the total volume conservation \ref{eq:volume_conservation}, and in the bulk velocity formulation \ref{eq:velocity_conservation}, an infinite number of moments are involved.
