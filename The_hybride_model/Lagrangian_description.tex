In this section, we present a Lagrangian-based model capable of describing the dispersed phase with an arbitrary order of accuracy.

\subsection{Fundamental properties}

At this stage, we define some fundamental properties associated to each particle labeled $\alpha$.
Following the strategy of \citet{lhuillier2009rheology,lhuillier1992volume,zaepffel2011modelisation} and \citet[Chapter 2]{morel2015mathematical}
we define the mass $m_\alpha$, position of center of mass $\mathbf{x}_\alpha$, and the momentum $\textbf{p}_\alpha$ of the particle $\alpha$, as
\begin{align}
    m_\alpha(t,\FF)
    = \intO{ \rho_d  }, 
    &&
    \textbf{x}_\alpha(t,\FF)
    = \frac{1}{m_\alpha(t,\FF) }\intO{ \rho_d \textbf{x} }, 
    &&\textbf{p}_\alpha(t,\FF) 
    = \intO{ \rho_d \textbf{u}_d^0 }.
    \label{eq:mass_pos}
    % \label{eq:momentum_energy}
\end{align}
$\Omega_\alpha(t,\FF)$ is the time-dependent domain occupied by the particle $\alpha$ (see \ref{fig:Scheme}). 
Subsequently, we define the velocity of the particle center of mass as
\begin{equation*}
\textbf{u}_\alpha = \frac{d \textbf{x}_\alpha}{dt}.
\end{equation*}
Replacing $\textbf{x}_\alpha$ by its definition (\ref{eq:mass_pos}) we obtain
\begin{equation*}
    \textbf{u}_\alpha = \frac{1}{m_\alpha}
    \frac{d}{dt} 
    \left(
        \intO{ \rho_d \textbf{x} }
    \right)
    - \frac{1}{m_\alpha^2} \frac{d}{dt} \left(\intO{ \rho_d } \right)
    \intO{ \rho_d \textbf{x} }.
\end{equation*}
%\tb{ A finaliser
Using the Reynolds transport theorem (\ref{eq:reynolds_transport}) for both terms in parentheses and making use of the conservation of mass (\ref{eq:dt_rho}) and the definition of $\textbf{x}_\alpha(t,\FF)$ in the last term, gives
\begin{equation}
    \textbf{u}_\alpha = 
    \frac{1}{m_\alpha}\intO{ \left[
        \pddt (\textbf{x}\rho_d ) + \div\left(\textbf{u}_d^0 \textbf{x} \rho_d\right) 
    \right]} \\
    + \frac{1}{m_\alpha}\intS{ \textbf{x} \rho_d(\textbf{u}_I   - \textbf{u}_d^0) \cdot \textbf{n}_d }
    -  \frac{\textbf{x}_\alpha}{m_\alpha}    \intS{ \rho_d(\textbf{u}_I   - \textbf{u}_d^0) \cdot \textbf{n}_d }
\end{equation}
Then by considering the mass conservation for the first term and noticing that $\grad \textbf{x} = \bm\delta$, for the second term gives, 
\begin{equation}
    \textbf{u}_\alpha(t,\FF) = \frac{1}{m_\alpha(t,\FF)} \left(
        \textbf{p}_\alpha(t,\FF)
        +  \intS{\rho_d \textbf{r} (\textbf{u}_I^0 - \textbf{u}_d^0)\cdot \textbf{n}_d }
        \right),
        \label{eq:dt_y_alpha}
\end{equation}
where $\textbf{r}(\textbf{x},t) = \textbf{x} - \textbf{x}_\alpha(t)$. 
In \ref{eq:dt_y_alpha}, it can be observed that the first component of the velocity represents the linear momentum divided by the mass of the particle. 
This corresponds to the mass-averaged velocity over the volume of the particle.
The second term in \ref{eq:dt_y_alpha} arises from the contribution of anisotropic mass transfer across the surface of the particle. 
This mass transfer leads to the motion of the particle's center of mass, thereby contributing to the total velocity.
To illustrate this concept, let us consider a fixed drop with no momentum lying over a very hot plate.
In this scenario, we assume that the plate is sufficiently hot to induce evaporation, specifically on the bottom portion of the drop.
Hence, under the effect of an anisotropic evaporation flux one may expect the second term to be non-negligible.
Consequently, the center of mass of the drop has a non-zero velocity in the opposite direction of the plate, even though the momentum is assumed to be zero.
Note that \ref{eq:dt_y_alpha} generalized usual expression of the center of mass velocity whom neglect the second term.
In the following, for the sake of brevity we discard the dependency on $t$ and $\FF$ on the notations for all Lagrangian quantities denoted by the subscript $_\alpha$ and in particular $\Gamma_\alpha$ and $\Omega_\alpha$.
Nevertheless, the reader must understand that all Lagrangian quantities and integration domains subscribed by $_\alpha$ are time and configuration-dependent. 

The particle's internal relative motions or the \textit{inner velocity} is given by $\textbf{w}_d^0 = \textbf{u}_d^0 - \textbf{u}_\alpha$. 
Substituting the inner velocity in the momentum definition (\ref{eq:mass_pos}) yields
\begin{equation}
    \label{eq:momentum_definition_1}
    \textbf{p}_\alpha
    = m_\alpha \textbf{u}_\alpha
    + \int_{\Omega_\alpha} \rho_d \textbf{w}_d^0 d\Omega.
\end{equation}
Alternatively, from \eqref{eq:dt_y_alpha}, we obtain,
\begin{equation}
    \textbf{p}_\alpha
    =  m_\alpha \textbf{u}_\alpha
    - \int_{\Gamma_\alpha} \rho_d\textbf{r}(\textbf{u}_I^0 - \textbf{u}_d^0)\cdot \textbf{n}_d d\Sigma
    \label{eq:momentum_definition}
\end{equation}
Therefore, the momentum of a particle can be seen as a sum of the mean velocity plus the integral of the fluctuation (\ref{eq:momentum_definition_1}), with the latter being equivalent to minus the first moment of mass transfer term (\ref{eq:momentum_definition}).
Indeed, by identification we obtain : $\intO{ \rho_d \textbf{w}_d^0 } = - \intS{  \rho_d\textbf{r} (\textbf{u}_I^0 - \textbf{u}_d^0)\cdot \textbf{n}_d }$. 
Hence, the internal velocity fluctuations within a fluid particle do not contribute to the total linear momentum $\textbf{p}_\alpha$, as long as the anisotropic mass transfer is negligible.  
Only within this simplified context we can consider the classic relation $\textbf{p}_\alpha = m_\alpha \textbf{u}_\alpha$. 

\subsection{Conservation laws}

We assign to a particle indexed, $\alpha$, occupying the domain $\Omega_\alpha$ (see \ref{fig:Scheme}) an arbitrary Lagrangian property $q_\alpha$ defined by $q_\alpha  = \intO{ f_d^0}$.
Similarly, we define $q_{I\alpha} = \intS{ f_I^0}$ as an integrated surface property of the particle $\alpha$.

\subsubsection{Inside the volume}
To describe the evolution of any arbitrary Lagrangian quantity $q_\alpha$, we need to establish its time derivative.
Since $q_\alpha$ is an integral quantity with a time-dependent domain of integration, we apply the general Reynolds transport theorem for volume integral which gives for material domains (here the droplet volume),
\begin{equation}
    \ddt  \intO{f_d^0}
    = \intO{\left[ \pddt f_d^0 + \div\left(f_d^0\textbf{u}_d^0\right) \right]}\\
    + \intS{ f_d^0 (\textbf{u}_I^0-\textbf{u}_d^0)\cdot \textbf{n}_d }.
    \label{eq:reynolds_transport}
\end{equation}
By substituting the integrand of the first integral on the right-hand side (RHS) with \ref{eq:dt_f_k} we obtain the conservation law of the quantity $q_\alpha$, namely,  
\begin{equation}
    \ddt{q_\alpha}
    = \intO{ s_d^0 }
    + \intS{ \left[
        f_d^0 (\textbf{u}_I^0-\textbf{u}_d^0) 
        + \mathbf{\Phi}_d^0 
        \right] \cdot \textbf{n}_d }.
    \label{eq:dt_q_alpha}
\end{equation}
In \ref{eq:dt_q_alpha} we used the Gauss divergence theorem to show that
\begin{equation}
    \intO{\div \mathbf{\Phi}_d^0} = \intS{\mathbf{\Phi}_d^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}.
\end{equation}
The first term on the right-hand side of \ref{eq:dt_q_alpha} accounts for the total contribution of the source term $s_d^0$ to the particle $\alpha$,
while the second term is the surface integration of the exchange terms, which includes the phase transfer flux $f_d^0 (\textbf{u}_I^0-\textbf{u}_d^0)$ and the diffusive flux $\mathbf{\Phi}_d^0$. 


Let us consider the specific case of the momentum balance, i.e. $q_\alpha = \textbf{p}_\alpha$.
In this situation, \ref{eq:dt_q_alpha} reads
\begin{equation}
    \ddt  \textbf{p}_\alpha
    = \intO{ \rho_d\textbf{g} }
    + \intS{ 
        \left[
        f_d^0 (\textbf{u}_I^0-\textbf{u}_d^0)
         + \bm{\sigma}_d^0%\cdot\textbf{n}_d  
        %+ \mathbf{\Phi}_d^0 
        \right] 
        \cdot \textbf{n}_d },
\end{equation}
% first term reads as $\intO{ \rho_d\textbf{g} }$ 
The first term on the right-hand side represents the total weight acting on the particle $\alpha$, 
the second term represents the total source of momentum due to phase transfer, and it is expressed as, $\intS{ \rho_d \textbf{u}_d^0 (\textbf{u}_I^0-\textbf{u}_d^0)\cdot\textbf{n}_d }$,
and the last term $\intS{ \bm{\sigma}_d^0\cdot\textbf{n}_d }$, represents the resultant of the hydrodynamic forces acting on the surface of the particle.
It is important to notice that under this form, the exchange terms are expressed as integrals of dispersed phase fields denoted by the subscript $_d$.
Nevertheless, depending on the nature of the dispersed phase, these fields may not always be defined.
For rigid particles the stress within the particle $\bm{\sigma}_d^0$ is indeterminate \citep{guazzelli2011}.  
Hence, our objective is to express these exchange terms, in terms of the continuous phase field quantities instead of the dispersed phase fields, i.e. in terms of $\mathbf{\Phi}_f^0$ and $\textbf{u}_f^0$ rather than $\mathbf{\Phi}_d^0$ and $\textbf{u}_d^0$. 

\subsubsection{On the interfaces}
To address this issue in a general manner, let us derive the conservation equation for the integrated surface property $q_{I\alpha} = \intS{f_I^0}$.
To differentiate time-varying surface integrals within time, we make use of the general Leibniz rule, which states that for an arbitrary function $f_I^0$ defined on $\Gamma(t)$ we have the relation \citep{nadim1996concise}
\begin{equation}
    \ddt  \intS{f_I^0 }
    = \intS{ \left[
        \pddt f_I^0
        +   \gradI \cdot (\textbf{u}_I^0f_I^0)
    \right]}.
    \label{eq:surface_derivative}
\end{equation}
Substituting the right-hand side terms of \ref{eq:surface_derivative} with \ref{eq:dt_f_I}, gives,
\begin{equation}
    \ddt  q_{I\alpha}
    = \intS{ 
        s_I^0
    }
    - \intS{
 \Jump{
        f_k^0 (\textbf{u}_I^0 - \textbf{u}_k^0)
        + \mathbf{\Phi}_k^0
    }
    }.
    \label{eq:dt_q_I_alpha}
\end{equation}
We have used the surface divergence theorem applied to closed surfaces \citep{nadim1996concise}, it reads
\begin{equation}
    \intS{\gradI F}
    = 
    \intS{ F \textbf{n} (\div \textbf{n})},
    \label{eq:gauss_surface}
\end{equation} 
where $F$ is an arbitrary field.
This theorem demonstrates that any surface property parallel to the tangential plane of $\Gamma$, such as $\bm\Phi_{I||}$, satisfies the relation $\intS{\divI \bm\Phi_{I||}^0}
= 0$.
This explains why $\bm\Phi_{I||}$ does not appear in \ref{eq:dt_q_I_alpha}. 
\ref{eq:surface_derivative} can be interpreted as the conservation equation for the integrated surface property $f_I^0$, or as the jump condition of the $f^0_k$ integrated on the droplet surface. 
As discussed above we wish to get rid of $\mathbf{\Phi}_d^0$ in \ref{eq:dt_q_alpha}. 
To achieve this, we treat the particle's volume and surface as a unified entity and derive a conservation equation for $q_\alpha^\text{tot} = q_\alpha + q_{I\alpha}$. 
By summing \ref{eq:dt_q_alpha} and \ref{eq:dt_q_I_alpha} we directly obtain 
\begin{equation}
    \ddt  q_\alpha^\text{tot}
    = 
    \intO{ s_d^0 }
    + \intS{ s_I^0 }
    + \intS{ \left[
        f_f^0 (\textbf{u}_I^0-\textbf{u}_f^0) 
        + \mathbf{\Phi}_f^0 
        \right] \cdot \textbf{n}_d }. 
    \label{eq:dt_q_alpha_tot}
\end{equation}
This equation is the general form of the linear conservation law for the quantity $q_\alpha^\text{tot}$.
It applies to any particle immersed into a continuous phase following the local conservation, \ref{eq:dt_f_k} and \ref{eq:dt_f_I}.
We refer to this equation as the zeroth-order conservation equation or the linear conservation law for the particle $\alpha$.

We would like to highlight that due to the consideration of closed surface, the diffusive flux $\mathbf{\Phi}_{I||}^0$, plays no role at all in \ref{eq:dt_q_alpha_tot}.
Therefore, in the case of the linear momentum conservation law, the contribution of the momentum diffusive flux $\bm\sigma_{I||}^0$ exposed in \ref{eq:dt_rhoIu_I}, will not contribute to the momentum balance of a particle, and we obtain the relation 
\begin{equation}
    \ddt  \textbf{p}_\alpha^\text{tot}
    = 
    \intO{ \rho_d^0\textbf{g} }
    + \intS{ \rho_I^0\textbf{g} }
    + \intS{ 
        \left[
        f_d^0 (\textbf{u}_I^0-\textbf{u}_f^0)
        + \bm{\sigma}_f^0
        \right] 
        \cdot \textbf{n}_d }. 
\end{equation}
In this case, note that $\textbf{p}_\alpha^\text{tot} = \intO{\rho^0_d \textbf{u}_d^0}+\intS{\rho^0_I \textbf{u}_I^0}$ is the momentum of the particle's volume and surface. 
The latter might be negligible if the interface has a negligible weight. 
As a consequence, even in the presence of local Marangoni forces or surface viscous stresses (see \ref{eq:surface_fluxes}), the resultant of the surface diffusive fluxes would still cancel out in the linear momentum balance.
This fact has already been demonstrated by \citet{hesla1993note} who showed that the surface tension force does not contribute to the linear and angular momentum balance. 
Here, we have provided the general proof that the interfacial diffusive flux $\mathbf{\Phi}_{I||}^0$, which is present at the local scale according to \ref{eq:dt_f_I}, does not contribute to the zeroth-order conservation law of a particle with a closed surface.

For completeness, we exposed in \ref{ap:particles_eq} a clear derivation of the mass, momentum and total energy equations for a single particle.
The derivation takes place using the same hypothesis as it is exposed in \ref{ap:hypothesis}.
Especially, it is shown that the integration of the kinetic energy jump condition corresponds to the Lagrangian derivative of the particle surface, see \ref{eq:int_u_I2}. 

\subsection{Higher moment equations}

Because $f_d^0$ and $f_I^0$ are not always constant over the volumes and surfaces of the particles, it is interesting to introduce in the first place, the first moment of the quantities $f_d^0$ and $f_I^0$. 
They are defined as
\begin{align}
    &\textbf{Q}_\alpha 
    = \intO{ \textbf{r} f_d^0 },
    &\text{and}&
    &\textbf{Q}_{I\alpha}
    = \intS{ \textbf{r} f_I^0 },
    \label{eq:first_moment_definition}
\end{align}
where we recall that $\textbf{r} = \textbf{x} - \textbf{x}_\alpha$ is the distance between any point inside $\Omega_\alpha$ or $\Gamma_\alpha$, to the center of mass of the particle $\alpha$.
It is then possible to differentiate these moments with respect to time to obtain their conservation laws.
We use the Reynolds transport theorem (\ref{eq:reynolds_transport}) to describe the evolution of $\textbf{Q}_\alpha$ within time. 
It gives, 
\begin{equation*}
    \frac{d}{dt} \textbf{Q}_\alpha
      =  \intO{\left[
        \pddt(  f_d^0\textbf{r})
        + \div \left(  f_d^0 \textbf{r}\textbf{u}_d^0\right)
    \right]} 
    + \intS{  f_d^0 \textbf{r}  (\textbf{u}_I^0-\textbf{u}_d^0)\cdot \textbf{n}_d}
\end{equation*}
The first term on the right-hand side may be rewritten as
\begin{equation*}
\intO{ \left[
        \pddt(\textbf{r}  f_d^0)+ \div \left( \textbf{u}_d^0 \textbf{r} f^0_d\right) 
    \right]}
    = \intO{\textbf{r}\left[
        \pddt f_d^0
        + \div \left(f_d^0 \textbf{u}_d^0\right)
    \right] }
    + \intO{ f_d^0 \left[
        \pddt \textbf{r}
        +(\textbf{u}_d^0 \cdot \grad) \textbf{r}
    \right]}
\end{equation*}
Using \ref{eq:dt_f_k} for the first integral on the right-hand side, and considering the relation,
$  \pddt \textbf{r}
+ (\textbf{u}_d^0 \cdot \grad) \textbf{r}
= - \frac{d}{dt} \textbf{y}_\alpha  + \textbf{u}_d^0 
= \textbf{w}_d^0$,
for the second integral yields 
\begin{align}
    \frac{d}{dt} \textbf{Q}_\alpha
    % &= \intO{\textbf{r} \left[
    %      s_d^0  +  \div \bm\Phi_d^0
    % \right]}
    % +\intO{f_d^0  \textbf{w}_d }
    % + \int_{\Gamma_\alpha} \textbf{r}  f_d^0 (\textbf{u}_I^0-\textbf{u}_d^0)\cdot \textbf{n}_d  d\Sigma,\\
    = \intO{\left( 
        \textbf{r} s_d^0  
        + f_d^0  \textbf{w}_d 
        - \bm\Phi_d^0
    \right) }
    + \int_{\Gamma_\alpha} \textbf{r} \left[
        \bm\Phi_d^0
        + f_d^0 (\textbf{u}_I^0-\textbf{u}_d^0)
    \right]\cdot \textbf{n}_d  d\Sigma.
    \label{eq:dt_Q_alpha}
\end{align}
Where we have used the relation $\intO{\textbf{r}  \div \bm\Phi_d^0 }
= \intS{ \textbf{r} \bm\Phi_d^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d }
- \intO{ \bm\Phi_d^0 }$. 
\ref{eq:dt_Q_alpha} is the first order moment conservation equation for the particle $\alpha$. 
Following the same procedure, and making use of \ref{eq:surface_derivative}, \ref{eq:gauss_surface} and \ref{eq:dt_f_I}, one can equally show that 
\begin{align}
    \ddt {\textbf{Q}_{I\alpha}}
    &= \intS{ \left(
        \textbf{r}s_I^0
        + f_I^0 \textbf{w}_I^0
        - \mathbf{\Phi}_{I||}^0
    \right) }
    - \intS{\textbf{r} 
    \Jump{\mathbf{\Phi}_k^0
        + f_k^0 (\textbf{u}_I^0 - \textbf{u}_k^0)
    }
    },
    \label{eq:dt_Q_I_alpha}
\end{align}
where $\textbf{w}_I^0 = \textbf{u}_{I||}^0 - \textbf{u}_\alpha$.
In \ref{eq:dt_Q_alpha}, we recognize the first moment of the source term $s_d^0$, the first moment of the diffusive flux term $\bm\Phi_d^0\cdot\textbf{n}_d$ and the first moment of phase exchange term, $f_d^0 (\textbf{u}_I^0-\textbf{u}_d^0)\cdot\textbf{n}_d$. 
Additionally, two supplementary terms appear in \ref{eq:dt_Q_alpha}, namely: the integral of the diffusive flux $\bm\Phi_d^0$, and a term related to the fluctuation of the internal velocity $f_d^0 \textbf{w}_d^0$.
Similar observations can be made for the first moment of surface equation \ref{eq:dt_Q_I_alpha}, as it shares similarities with \ref{eq:dt_Q_alpha}. 
In particular, it is worth noting the presence of the surface diffusive flux $\mathbf{\Phi}_{I||}^0$ in \ref{eq:dt_Q_I_alpha}.
This term will be further discussed in the following. 

For similar reason than the linear conservation equations, we sum \ref{eq:dt_Q_alpha} and \ref{eq:dt_Q_I_alpha} to expresses the conservation equation of the total first moment $\textbf{Q}_\alpha^\text{tot} = \textbf{Q}_\alpha + \textbf{Q}_{I\alpha}$, this yields 
\begin{multline}
    \ddt {\textbf{Q}_\alpha^\text{tot}}
    = \intO{ \left(
        \textbf{r} s_d^0         
        + f_d^0  \textbf{w}_d^0 
        - \mathbf{\Phi}_d^0
    \right) }
    + \intS{ \left(
        \textbf{r}s_I^0
        + f_I^0 \textbf{w}_I^0
        - \mathbf{\Phi}_{I||}^0
    \right) }
    + \intS{ \textbf{r} \left[
        \mathbf{\Phi}_f^0
        + f_f^0 (\textbf{u}_I^0-\textbf{u}_f^0)
    \right]\cdot \textbf{n}_d  }. 
    \label{eq:dt_Q_alpha_tot}
\end{multline}
Likewise, conservation laws can be derived for the $n^{th}$ order moments of volume and surface, i.e. for
\begin{align}
    \textbf{Q}_{\alpha n}
    = \intO{
         \underbrace{\textbf{rr}\ldots \textbf{rr}}_{n\text{ times}}
        f_d^0 },
        && \text{and} &&
    \textbf{Q}_{I\alpha n}
    = \intS{
         \underbrace{\textbf{rr}\ldots \textbf{rr}}_{n\text{ times}}
    f_I^0 },
    \label{eq:Q_n_definition}
\end{align} 
respectively. 
It can be shown that the derivative with time of $\textbf{Q}_{\alpha n}$ and $\textbf{Q}_{I\alpha n}$ do not involve any additional terms than in \ref{eq:dt_Q_alpha} and \ref{eq:dt_Q_I_alpha}, but rather just the $n^{th}$ order moments of the already presented terms.
We provide the full derivation of $\ddt{ \textbf{Q}_{\alpha n}}$ in \ref{ap:Moments_equations}.
In short, these higher order moments describe the distributions of the local quantities $f_d^0$ and $f_I^0$ inside the domain $\Omega_\alpha$ and $\Gamma_\alpha$, respectively.
Consequently, an infinite number of moments would be theoretically necessary to recover the fields $f_d^0$ and $f_I^0$ within $\Omega_\alpha$ and $\Gamma_\alpha$. 
Thus, one can reach an arbitrary order of accuracy upon the knowledge of an arbitrary number of moments for a given quantity.  

\subsection{Discussion}

To gain physical insight into the meaning of the first and higher moment equations, we now consider the case of mass and momentum conservation laws for a particle of arbitrary shape. 
For ease of understanding, we adopt the simplifying hypotheses presented in \ref{ap:hypothesis}. 
This implies that we consider no mass transfer across phases and no surface properties except for surface tension forces.

Following \ref{eq:Q_n_definition} we define the second-order moment of mass and the first-order moment of momentum as respectively,
\begin{equation}
    \textbf{M}_\alpha 
    = \intO{ \rho_d \textbf{r} \textbf{r} }
    \;\;\;\text{and}\;\;\;
    \textbf{P}_\alpha 
    = \intO{ \rho_d \textbf{r} \textbf{u}_d^0 }.
    \label{eq:first_moment_of_momentum_def}
\end{equation}
Note that $\textbf{M}_\alpha$ is analogous to the inertia tensor $\textbf{I}_\alpha$ in solid mechanics, both are related through the expression $\textbf{I}_\alpha = \bm\delta : \textbf{M}_\alpha - \textbf{M}_\alpha$.
For a constant density, the tensor $\textbf{M}_\alpha$ describes the second moment of the volume distribution around the particle center of mass.
Likewise, the tensor $\textbf{P}_\alpha$ describes the first moment of the velocity distribution within the particle volume. 
To provide a clearer physical interpretation of the moment of momentum tensor, we decompose $\textbf{P}_\alpha$ into two distinct parts. 
Namely, 
$\textbf{P}_\alpha = \textbf{S}_\alpha+\textbf{T}_\alpha$, where $\textbf{S}_\alpha$ represents the symmetric part and $\textbf{T}_\alpha$ is the antisymmetric part of $\textbf{P}_\alpha$.
Then, the tensors $\textbf{S}_\alpha$ and $\textbf{T}_\alpha$ correspond respectively to the stretching and angular momentum of the particle $\alpha$. 
The tensor $\textbf{S}_\alpha$ quantifies how fast and in which direction the particle gets elongated or flattened, in other words it represents the mean rate of deformation experienced by the particle.
The tensor $\textbf{T}_\alpha$ is related to the angular momentum of the particle denoted by the pseudo vector $\bm\mu_\alpha = \intO{ \rho_d \textbf{r} \times \textbf{u}_d^0 }$. 
Indeed, both  $\textbf{T}_\alpha$ and $\bm{\mu}_\alpha$ represent the angular momentum and are related through $(\bm{\mu}_\alpha)_i = \epsilon_{ijk} (\textbf{P}_\alpha)_{jk}= \epsilon_{ijk} (\textbf{T}_\alpha)_{jk}$, where $\bm\epsilon$ is the third order alternating unit tensor or Levi-Cita tensor. 
Lastly, we also introduce the scalar $M_\alpha =\frac{1}{3}\bm\delta : \textbf{P}_\alpha = \frac{1}{3}\intO{ \rho_d \textbf{r} \cdot \textbf{u}_d^0 }.$, which quantifies the rate at which the particle is being compressed or expanded.
To better explain the implication of these quantities on the particle kinematics we provide in \ref{eq:scheme}, three schemes representing possible inner velocity fields with their corresponding value of the moment of momentum tensor.
Note that in \ref{eq:scheme} we explicit

Injecting, $f_d^0 = \rho_d$ in the second-order moment equation (derived in \ref{ap:Moments_equations}) we obtain :
\begin{equation}
    \ddt {\textbf{M}_\alpha}=2\textbf{S}_\alpha. 
    \label{eq:dt_M_alpha}
\end{equation}
which is the second-order moment of mass conservation equation. 
From \ref{eq:dt_M_alpha} we deduce that the evolution of the distribution of mass of a particle is solely motivated by the stretching of momentum $\textbf{S}_\alpha$. 
This implies that the angular momentum (not to be confused with the angular velocity) plays no role in the evolution of the second moment of mass. 
This is due to the symmetry of the tensor $\textbf{M}_\alpha$, which must be preserved after differentiation with respect to time.
Note that if the particle has a constant $\textbf{M}_\alpha$ under change of reference frame, such as for spherical particles where we can write $\textbf{M}_\alpha= \frac{a^2 m_\alpha}{5} \bm\delta$, then $\textbf{S}_\alpha=0$ since $\ddt \textbf{M}_\alpha = 0$ in this situation.
This argument has no restriction on the internal particle motions, thus it is also true for fluid particles with possible inner motion. 
Additionally, applying the trace operator on both sides of \ref{eq:dt_M_alpha}, yields the interesting relation $\ddt {M_\alpha}=\frac{2}{3}\bm\delta : \textbf{S}_\alpha$.
We can state that $M_\alpha = \lambda^\alpha_1(t)+\lambda^\alpha_d(t)+\lambda^\alpha_3(t)$, with $\lambda_i^\alpha$ for $i=1,2,3$, the eigenvalues of $\textbf{M}_\alpha$, as it is a symmetric tensor and thus always diagonalizable.
For undeformable particles, it is evident that the eigenvalues are not functions of time, implying $\ddt M_\alpha = 0$.  
Consequently, $\bm\delta : \textbf{S}_\alpha$ possesses the notable property of being zero whenever the particle shape remains constant, regardless of the orientation.

Now that we have described the kinematics of the particle shape, let us proceed to derive an equation for the dynamics of the particle shape, i.e. an equation for the moment of momentum. 
This equation is derived injecting $\textbf{Q}_\alpha = \textbf{P}_\alpha$ in \ref{eq:dt_Q_alpha_tot}, it reads, 
\begin{equation}
    \ddt {\textbf{P}_\alpha}
    - \intO{ \rho_d  \textbf{w}_d^0 \textbf{w}_d^0 }
    = 
    - \intO{\bm{\sigma}_d^0}
    - \intS{ 
        \gamma (\bm\delta - \textbf{nn})
    }
    + \intS{ \textbf{r}\bm{\sigma}_f^0\cdot \textbf{n}_d}.
    \label{eq:dt_P_alpha}
\end{equation}
On the left-hands side of \ref{eq:dt_P_alpha} we identify two inertial terms, i.e. the derivative of $\textbf{P}_\alpha$ and the internal velocity term $\intO{\rho_d\textbf{w}_d^0\textbf{w}_d^0 }$.
The inertia of the particle is then balanced by the terms on the right-hand side of the equation, namely: 
the integral of the particle internal stress $\intO{ \bm{\sigma}_d^0}$; 
the integral of the surface tension stress $\intS{ \gamma (\bm\delta- \textbf{nn}) }$; 
and the first moment of the hydrodynamic stress tensor, $\intS{\textbf{r}\bm\sigma_f^0\cdot \textbf{n}}$.
A discussion regarding the physical implications of this equation is provided below. 

The conservation equation of the angular momentum $\bm{\mu}_\alpha$ is obtained by taking the double contracted product of \ref{eq:dt_P_alpha} with $\bm\epsilon$, which gives 
\begin{equation}
    \ddt\bm{\mu}_\alpha
    =  
    % \textbf{t}_\alpha.
    \intS{ \textbf{r} \times \bm{\sigma}_f^0\cdot \textbf{n}_d }
    \label{eq:dt_mu_alpha}
\end{equation}
Notice that every term on the right-hand side of \ref{eq:dt_P_alpha} vanished due to their symmetric nature apart from the shew-symmetric part of the hydrodynamic stress, which is the hydrodynamic torque applied on the particle $\alpha$.
Particularly, the surface tension terms do not appear in the angular momentum balance since $\bm\sigma_I^0 = \gamma (\bm\delta-\textbf{nn})$ is symmetric, which is consistent with the findings of \citet{hesla1993note}. 
As a consequence, the surface tension does not affect the angular momentum regardless of the particle's shape. 
In the literature, it is common to include the torque due to inter-particular interactions in the angular momentum balance, as is done in \citet{jackson1997locally} and \citet{zhang1997momentum}.
In our case note that $\bm{\sigma}_f^0$ contains also short-range interaction forces which can be assimilated to the particle-particle interaction forces.

Taking the double contracted product of \ref{eq:dt_P_alpha} with the tensor $\bm\delta$ and using \ref{eq:dt_M_alpha}, yields directly  
% \begin{equation}
%     \frac{1}{2}\ddt^2 {M_\alpha}
%     - \frac{1}{3}\intO{ \rho_d \textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \textbf{w}_d^0}
%     = 
%     \intO{p_d^0} 
%     % - \frac{1}{3}\intS{p_f^0 \textbf{r}\cdot \textbf{n}}
%     - \frac{2}{3} \gamma s_\alpha
%     - \frac{1}{3}\intS{p_f^0 \textbf{r}\cdot \textbf{n}}
%     + \frac{1}{3}\intS{\textbf{r}\cdot\bm\tau_f^0\cdot \textbf{n}},
%     \label{eq:dt_D_alpha}
% \end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{3}{2}\frac{d^2 M_\alpha}{dt^2}
    - \intO{ \rho_d \textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \textbf{w}_d^0}
    = 
    - \intO{\bm\sigma_d^0:\bm\delta} 
    % - \frac{1}{3}\intS{p_f^0 \textbf{r}\cdot \textbf{n}}
    - \gamma 2 \intS{}
    % - \frac{1}{3}\intS{p_f^0 \textbf{r}\cdot \textbf{n}}
    + \intS{\textbf{r}\cdot\bm\sigma_f^0\cdot \textbf{n}}.
    \label{eq:dt_D_alpha}
\end{equation}
\ref{eq:dt_D_alpha}, corresponds to the isotropic work balance over the volume and surface of the particle. 
According to \ref{eq:dt_D_alpha}, the rate of compression of a particle, denoted by the second derivative of $M_\alpha$ evolves according to : 
the internal inertial term, $\intO{\rho_d \textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \textbf{w}_d^0 }$;
the particle internal pressure $\intO{\bm\sigma_d^0:\bm\delta}$; 
the surface energy $\gamma\intS{  }$; 
and the trace of the hydrodynamic first moment $\intS{\textbf{r}\cdot\bm\sigma_f^0\cdot \textbf{n}}$.
If one considers spherical particles composed of compressible fluid, \ref{eq:dt_D_alpha} transforms into the Rayleigh-Lamb-Plesset equation. 
In the steady-state regime, this reduces to the Young-Laplace equation, as indicated by the presence of the first three terms on the right-hand side of \ref{eq:dt_D_alpha}. 

\tb{
    As an example we now consider the \textit{Rayleigh-Lamb-Plesset} equation for spherical bubbles with radius $a_\alpha(t)$. 
    As the droplets remain spherical while keeping a constant mass the moment of momentum and inner velocity field can be expressed, 
    \begin{align*}
        M_\alpha
        = \frac{m_\alpha}{5} a^2_\alpha(t),
        && 
        \textbf{w}_d^0
        = \frac{d a_\alpha}{dt}\frac{\textbf{r}}{a_\alpha(t)},
        \label{eq:expr1}
    \end{align*}
    where it is empathized that the radius $a_\alpha(t)$ is time-dependent. 
    The stress inside the bubbles might be expressed as compressible Newtonian fluids with no resistance to shear such that 
    \begin{equation}
        \bm\sigma_d^0 
        = 
        - p_d^0 \bm\delta
        - \lambda_d (\div \textbf{u}_d^0) \bm\delta
        % + \mu_d \left[\grad \textbf{u}_d^0 + (\grad \textbf{u}_d^0)^\dagger\right]
        = 
        - p_d^0 \bm\delta
        - \frac{3 \lambda_d}{a_\alpha} \frac{d a_\alpha}{dt}  \bm\delta
        % + \mu_d \left[\grad \textbf{u}_d^0 + (\grad \textbf{u}_d^0)^\dagger\right]
        \label{eq:StressBubbles}
    \end{equation}
    where $\lambda_d^0$ is the volume viscosity of the dispersed phase. 
    Assuming incompressible Newtonian fluid for the continuous phase and injecting the expressions \ref{eq:StressBubbles} and \ref{eq:expr1} into \ref{eq:dt_D_alpha} yields, 
    \begin{equation}
        \frac{1}{5} \rho_d^0 a_\alpha \frac{d^2 a_\alpha}{dt^2} 
        - 
        \frac{1}{a_\alpha} \frac{d a_\alpha}{dt} 
        \left(
            3 \lambda_d
            + 2 \mu_f 
        \right)
        = 
        +  \frac{1}{v_\alpha}\intO{p_d^0}
        -  \frac{1}{s_\alpha}\intS{p_f^0}
        - \gamma  \frac{2}{a}
    \end{equation}
    By expressing the fluid pressure on the surface in terms of the far field pressure (see daniel) one obtain the \textit{Rayleigh-Lamb-Plesset} equation. 
    In the static regime we recover laplace eq
}

Taking the symmetric part of \ref{eq:dt_P_alpha}, and making use of \ref{eq:dt_M_alpha}, yields a dynamical balance equation for $\textbf{M}_\alpha$, namely
% \begin{multline}    
%     \frac{1}{2}\ddt^2{\textbf{M}_\alpha^\text{dev}}
%     - \intO{\left(
%         \rho_d\textbf{w}_d^0 \textbf{w}_d^0
%         - \rho_d\frac{1}{3}(\textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \textbf{w}_d^0)\bm\delta\right)}
%     =  
%         - \mu_d \intO{\textbf{e}_d^0}
%         - \intS{\gamma\left(\frac{1}{3}\bm\delta-\textbf{nn}\right)}\\
%         + \frac{1}{2}\intS{\left(\textbf{r}\bm\sigma_f^0+ \bm\sigma_f^0\textbf{r} - \frac{2}{3}(\bm\sigma_f^0\cdot \textbf{r})\bm\delta\right)\cdot \textbf{n}}
%     \label{eq:dt_S_alpha}
% \end{multline}
\begin{equation}    
    \frac{1}{2}\frac{d^2 \textbf{M}_\alpha}{dt^2}
    - \intO{ \rho_d  \textbf{w}_d^0 \textbf{w}_d^0 }
    = 
    - \intO{\bm{\sigma}_d^0}
    - \intS{\gamma (\bm\delta - \textbf{nn})}
    + \intS{(\textbf{r}\bm{\sigma}_f^0+\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \textbf{r})\cdot \textbf{n}_d}.
    \label{eq:dt_S_alpha}
\end{equation}
On the left-hand side of \ref{eq:dt_S_alpha}, we recover the symmetric part of the inertial contributions. 
Especially, in opposition to \ref{eq:dt_P_alpha} we could substitute $\textbf{P}_\alpha+\textbf{P}_\alpha^\dagger$ by $\ddt \textbf{M}_\alpha$. 
Consequently, \ref{eq:dt_S_alpha} is a dynamical equation for the droplet mean deformation. 
In our case, only the external contribution $\frac{1}{2}\intS{\textbf{r}\bm\sigma_f^0\cdot \textbf{n}}$ is responsible for the generation of angular momentum, see \ref{eq:dt_mu_alpha}.
Taking the symmetric part of this tensor ultimately removes this contribution. 
Thus, on the right-hand side of \ref{eq:dt_S_alpha}, we identify the terms responsible for the droplet deformation exclusively.
Therefore, \ref{eq:dt_S_alpha} must be interpreted as an equation for the shape of the particle, represented by the tensor $\textbf{M}_\alpha$.

One might immediately recognize that this equation is in fact an extension of Batchelor’s famous result, 
\begin{equation}
    \intO{\bm{\sigma}_d^0}
    + \intS{\gamma(\bm\delta - \textbf{nn})}
    = \frac{1}{2}\intS{(\textbf{r}\bm\sigma_f^0+\bm\sigma_f^0\textbf{r})\cdot \textbf{n}},
    \label{eq:Batchelor}
\end{equation}
but with the consideration of the inertia of the particle.
\ref{eq:Batchelor} is particularly useful to express the unknown internal stress within solid particles (in which case $\gamma = 0$), in terms of surface integral, i.e. the stresslet $\intS{(\textbf{r}\bm\sigma_d^0+ \bm\sigma_d^0\textbf{r})\cdot \textbf{n}}$.
This relation is the main tool used to express the bulk stress of a suspension, it eventually leads to the computation of the famous Einstein equivalent viscosity, upon having a closed expression for the average of $\intS{(\textbf{r}\bm\sigma_d^0+ \bm\sigma_d^0\textbf{r})\cdot \textbf{n}}$ \citep{guazzelli2011}. 
In the inertial case, due to the limited degree of freedom of solid particles, the tensors $\textbf{M}_\alpha$ and the inner velocity field $\textbf{w}_d^0$ are fully determined by \ref{eq:dt_M_alpha} and \ref{eq:dt_mu_alpha}, indicating that $\textbf{M}_\alpha$ and $\textbf{w}_d^0$ can be utilized in \ref{eq:dt_S_alpha} not as unknowns but as source terms. 
Consequently, for solid particles, \ref{eq:dt_S_alpha} must be interpreted as a generalized equation for the undefined stress $\bm\sigma_d^0$ integrated on the volume of the particles.
Whether it is solid or fluid particles \ref{eq:dt_S_alpha} becomes particularly relevant for expressing the averaged stress within an inertial suspension in terms of Lagrangian properties, as discussed in section \ref{sec:averaged_eq}.

It is now clear that if the surface tension forces play no role in the linear and angular momentum equation, it does impact the moment of momentum $\textbf{P}_\alpha$ or more specifically its symmetric part $\textbf{S}_\alpha$.
Thus, the surface tension force impacts the hydrodynamic behavior of a particle solely through its action on $\textbf{S}_\alpha$, which is related to the shape of a particle represented by $\textbf{M}_\alpha$, through \ref{eq:dt_M_alpha}.
In \ref{ap:Moments_equations} we show how to derive the higher-order moment of momentum equations, which can also be viewed as formulas for the higher moments of the internal particle stress distribution. 
It is interesting to mention that in a recent study of \citet{dolata2021faxen} and \citet{zhou2020lamb} they use energy methods and recover the first two moments of momentum equations hidden into another but equivalent form, valid in the Stokes flow regime. 

Hence, the moment of momentum emerges as a quantity of utmost importance for all types of particles with variable shape or volume. In general, the first moments $\textbf{Q}_{\alpha}$ and $\textbf{Q}_{I\alpha}$ hold significant importance when considering particles with high internal gradients, i.e. when $\grad f_d^0$ or $\gradI f_I^0$ are non-negligible at the scale of one particle.
