\subsection{Application to spherical droplets}
In this section we consider spherical rising droplets in stokes flow.

\subsubsection*{The droplets internal motions}
In this situation the inner fields of the particle can be described by :
\begin{equation}
    \textbf{w}_2^0(\textbf{x}_\alpha + \textbf{r}) = 
    \left[
        \textbf{c}
        +
        \textbf{e}(2r^2\textbf{I}
        - \textbf{rr})
    \right]
    (\textbf{u}_\alpha - \textbf{u}_\infty) 
    - \textbf{u}_\alpha
\end{equation}
with$ \textbf{c}= \frac{1}{2}\frac{2\lambda +3}{\lambda +1}$ and $\textbf{e} = -\frac{1}{a^2}
\frac{1}{2\lambda+2}$. 
In this situation the first moment of momentum and mass of the particle identically vanish. 
However here we are rather interested on the energy equation. 

\subsubsection*{The simplified equation }
\subsubsection*{The exchange terms of forces etc }
\subsubsection*{The exchange terms $\textbf{c}_p$}
\subsubsection*{The dissipation term $\textbf{d}_p$}
