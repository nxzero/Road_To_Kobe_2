\section{Introduction}



\begin{itemize}
    \item Give a brief introduction on disperse multiphase flow and insist on the various existing nature :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item suspension of spherical, cylindrical solid particle.
        \item Suspension of deformable particle (blood cells in blood\ldots)
        \item Emulsion : water/oil
        \item Bubbly flows : air/water, air/concrete \ldots
        \item Regarding the physics we can have many mass transfer , compression , etc..
    \end{itemize}
    \item Therefore, our paper is of the main importance because it conciliates any of these case in one unique model. 
    Besides, mention why we insist on the specific application case given in outro. 
    \item Review the literature :
    \begin{itemize}
        \item  hard spheres \citet{batchelor1972sedimentation,jackson1997locally}
        \item  spherical bubble \citet{zhang1994averaged,zhang1994ensemble}
        \item  More complicated shape : (Batchelor)
        \item Work of \citet{morel2015mathematical} (morel, lhuiller and other) for deformable bubbles and surface transport. 
        \item Lagrangian models,  PBE and GPBE \citet{fox2023generalized} 
    \end{itemize}
    \item  Missing work : 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A general derivation of the hybrid model for all higher moments equations and all conservation laws. (published in \citet{morel2015mathematical} and \citet{zaepffel2012multisize} in specific cases)
        \item Consideration of the surafce properties of the particle (in \citet{morel2015mathematical} they assume that there is no surface properties)
        \item Proof of the equivalence between the dispersed and continuous formalism of the dispersed phase in the most general case and for volumic and surface quantities : 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item 
            It has been treated by \citet{lhuillier2000bilan} in the restricted case of the air density conservation equation considering spherical particle.
            \item \citet{nott2011suspension} investigated this topic also, but their conclusion is not appropriate since they do not deal with the higher moments equations. thus their conclusion is somewhat incomplete. 
        \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
    \item  For all those reason it is of the most important to provide a well posed model which is able to describe any kind of dispersed flows from the local conservation equation. 
    \item Therefore in this paper we re derived the hybrid model for dispersed two phase flow by considering surface and volumic properties of arbitrary shaped particle.
\end{itemize}
