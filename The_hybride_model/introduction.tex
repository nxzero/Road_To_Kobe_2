\section{Introduction}


\citet{nott2011suspension} demonstrated that the continuous averaged momentum equation, for mono disperse suspension of solid spheres, were \textit{strictly equivalent} to the particular averaged momentum equation.
While they didn't provide many details on the derivation of this equivalence, they limited their study to mono disperse suspension of solid spherical particles.
Originally, this work pointed out that no term expressed as the divergence of a stress appear in the particular averaged momentum balance.
However, from their arguments, the dispersed phase momentum equation must possess a non-convective terms.
The same holds for the surface conservation laws, as pointed out by \citet{lhuillier2000bilan}.
In \citet{lhuillier2000bilan} they treat a similar problem regarding the comparison of the particular and continuous averaged area transport equation. 
Anyhow, our motivation is to extend this equivalence principle to any system of dispersed two-phase flows conservation equations.
Besides, we re interpret the \textit{equivalence} meaning.
