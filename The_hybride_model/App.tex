\section{Hybrid formulation}
\label{sec:hybridchap2}


Now that we reached a clear understanding of the mathematical structures of the averaged two-phase flow equations we now expose the averaged set of equations that constitute the \textit{Hybrid model}. 
In this section, we consider the simplifying assumption exposed in \ref{ap:hypothesis}. 
As mentioned in \ref{sec:two-fluid} we derive the mass, momentum, and energy for the particles and continuous phase. 
Additionally, to describe the particle shape and inner velocity, one must consider the second moment of mass and the first moment of momentum averaged equations. 
This makes a total of 10 equations, 6 for the particle phase and 4 for the continuous phase.

% To support the subsequent discussion, we provide the expressions of the closure terms of a dilute emulsion of spherical droplets. 
% We will consider a monodisperse suspension of droplets with radius $a$ and constant viscosity $\lambda \mu_f$. 
% It must be understood that our goal is not to derive a set of equations for non-inertial spherical particles, in which case the energy equations and first-order moment equations would be unnecessary. 
% Instead, we provide the closures in Stokes flow regime to illustrate their physical implication. 
% Thus, even though the closures are expressed in the Stokes limit, note that the set of equations provided remains valid regardless of the flow regime.


\subsection{Continuous phases averaged equations}


The equations for the carrier fluid are the same as in the classic two-fluid model derived in \ref{ap:two-fluid_model}, except that the interfacial terms of the form $\avg{\delta_I \ldots }$ need to be reformulated.
Indeed, the interfacial terms must be reformulated in terms of particle-averaged quantities to be consistent with the particle-phase equations \citep{jackson1997locally,zhang1994averaged}. 
This is achieved through the use of \ref{eq:f_exp} which enables us to convert the exchange terms appearing in \ref{eq:avg_dt_chi_f} into a series expansion of particle phase quantities. 
For clarity, we only retain the first, second, and sometimes third-order terms of this expansion. 
The continuous phase averaged mass, momentum, and total energy equations yield, 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_rho}
    &\pddt (\phi_f \rho_f)  
    + \div (
        \phi_f \rho_f\textbf{u}_f
    )
    = 
    0,\\
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_rhou_f}
    &\pddt (\phi_f \rho_f\textbf{u}_f)  
    + \div (
        \phi_f \rho_f\textbf{u}_f\textbf{u}_f
        + \bm{\sigma}_f^\text{eq}
    )
    = 
    \phi_f \rho_f \textbf{g} 
    - \pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}},
    % +\div  \pSavg{{\textbf{r}\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    \\
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_rhoE_f}
    &\pddt (\phi_f\rho_fE_f)  
    + \div (
        \phi_f\rho_fE_f\textbf{u}_f
        + \bm{q}_f^\text{eq}
        + \textbf{u}_f \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^\text{eq}
        % - \textbf{u}_f^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 
        % + \textbf{q}_f^0
        )
    = 
    \phi_f \rho_f\textbf{u}_f \cdot \textbf{g} 
    - \textbf{u}_p \cdot \pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}\nonumber \\
    &- \pavg{ \textbf{u}_\alpha' \cdot \intS{  \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    - \pavg{ \intS{\textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    + \pSavg{{\textbf{q}_f\cdot \textbf{n}_d}},
    % &\div [    
        % \textbf{u}_p \cdot \pSavg{{ \textbf{r}\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    % + \pavg{ \textbf{u}_\alpha' \cdot \intS{ \textbf{r} \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    % + \pavg{ \intS{\textbf{r}\textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    % - \pavg{ \intS{\textbf{r}  \textbf{q}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    % ]
\end{align} 
respectively. 
Where we have introduced the equivalent stress tensor $\bm{\sigma}_f^\text{eq}$ and equivalent energy flux $\textbf{q}^\text{eq}_f$ as,
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:sigma_eq_def}
    \bm{\sigma}_f^\text{eq}
    =& 
    \avg{\chi_f\rho_f\textbf{u}_f'\textbf{u}_f'}
    - \phi_f \bm{\sigma}_f%- n_p \textbf{M}_p
    - \pSavg{{\textbf{r}\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    +\frac{1}{2}\div \pSavg{{\textbf{rr}\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    + \ldots
    \\
    \textbf{q}_f^\text{eq}
    =&\textbf{q}_f^\text{e} +\textbf{q}_f^\text{k} \nonumber \\
    \textbf{q}_f^\text{e}
    =& \rho_f \avg{\chi_f \textbf{u}_f' e_f'} 
    + \phi_f\textbf{q}_f 
    +\pSavg{{\textbf{r}\textbf{q}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}} 
    -\frac{1}{2}\div \pSavg{{\textbf{rr}\textbf{q}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}} 
    + \ldots
    \\
    \textbf{q}_f^\text{k}
    =& \rho_f \avg{\chi_f \textbf{u}_f' k_f} 
    - \avg{\chi_f \textbf{u}_f' \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0}
    + (\textbf{u}_f - \textbf{u}_p)\cdot
    \pSavg{{\textbf{r}\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    \label{eq:q_f_k_def}
    \\\nonumber &
    - \pavg{ \textbf{u}_\alpha' \cdot \intS{ \textbf{r} \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    - \pavg{ \intS{\textbf{r}\textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    + \div[\ldots]
\end{align}
Those equations yield essentially the same as the previous set of equations presented in \ref{ap:two-fluid_model}.
The only difference is the presence of additional terms inside $\bm{\sigma}^\text{eq}_f$ and $\textbf{q}^\text{eq}_f$ due to the expansion of the interfacial terms. 
The $[\ldots]$ in \ref{eq:sigma_eq_def} to \ref{eq:q_f_k_def} refers to the higher moments of the expansion of the interfacial terms that are not displayed here for the purpose of clarity. 
The averaged continuous-phase momentum balance \eqref{eq:dt_hybrid_rhou_f} under its \textit{hybrid} form was established long ago by \citet{zhang1997momentum,jackson1997locally}.  
\ref{eq:dt_hybrid_rhou_f} is of course consistent with the formulation given by these authors.

Now let us present the ``hybrid'' formulation for $\bm\sigma_f^\text{eq}$ and $\phi_f\bm{\sigma}_f$.  
From \ref{eq:first_form} we may directly write, 
\begin{equation}
    \phi_f\bm\sigma_f
    = 
    - p_f \bm\delta + 2 \mu_f \textbf{e}
    +\avg{\chi_d ( p_f\bm\delta - 2 \mu_f\textbf{e}_d^0)} 
    % \label{eq:def_sigma_f}
\end{equation}
Upon developing the term $\avg{\chi_d ( p_f\bm\delta - \textbf{e}_d^0)}$ in a multipolar series using \ref{eq:f_exp}, the equivalent stress of the fluid phase can be reformulated as, 
\begin{multline}
    \bm{\sigma}^\text{eq}_f = 
    p_f \bm\delta 
    - 2\mu_f \textbf{e} 
    +\avg{\rho_f\chi_f\textbf{u}_f'\textbf{u}_f'} 
    - \pOavg{(p_f\bm\delta - 2\mu_f\textbf{e}_d^0)}
    - \pSavg{\textbf{r}\bm{\sigma}_f^0\cdot \textbf{n}_d}
    \\
    + \div \left[
        \frac{1}{2} \pSavg{\textbf{rr}\bm{\sigma}_f^0\cdot \textbf{n}_d}
        + \pOavg{ \textbf{r}(p_f\bm\delta - 2\mu_f\textbf{e}_d^0) }
        + \ldots
    \right].
    \label{eq:sigma_eq_hybrid}
\end{multline} 
The two terms on the right-hand side represents what is called the ``stresslet'' quantity, while the terms on the second line represents the contribution from the higher moments. 

Now, let us discuss the continuous-phase averaged total energy balance \eqref{eq:dt_hybrid_rhoE_f}. 
Most of the terms have already been addressed in \ref{ap:two-fluid_model}, so for now, let's direct our attention to the exchange terms that have been re-formulated in this \textit{hybrid model}. 
Indeed, after taking the Taylor expansion of the interfacial term $\avg{\delta_I (\textbf{u}^0_d \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d)}$ on the right-hand side of \ref{eq:dt_avg_rhoE_k}, we used the following decomposition on each of the moments:
\begin{multline}
    \label{eq:exergysource}
    \pavg{ \intS{\textbf{u}^0_d \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    = \\
    \textbf{u}_p \cdot \pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    + \pavg{ \textbf{u}_\alpha' \cdot \intS{  \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    + \pavg{ \intS{\textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}},
%     \label{eq:exergysource2}
%     \pavg{ \intS{\textbf{r}\textbf{u}^0_d \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
%    &= 
%     \textbf{u}_p \cdot \pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
%     + \pavg{ \textbf{u}_\alpha' \cdot \intS{\textbf{r}  \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
%     + \pavg{ \intS{\textbf{r}\textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}},
\end{multline}
where we have noted that $\textbf{u}_d^0 = \textbf{u}_p + \textbf{u}_\alpha' +\textbf{w}_d^0$ according to \ref{eq:def_fluc_p} and to the definition of the particles \textit{inner velocity} $\textbf{w}_d^0$. 
Under this form the contribution of the kinetic energy exchange is explicit. 
Indeed, the first term on the right-hands side of \ref{eq:exergysource} represents the work done by the mean particle-phase motion with the mean drag force.
The second term is the covariance term of the velocity of the particles with their respective drag forces.
Note that in a dilute suspension, the drag force applied on each particle is likely to be a function of its instantaneous velocity, such as in \ref{eq:first_mom}, thus in a general manner this term is non-negligible. 
The last term represents the work made by the local force traction on the particle surface with the velocity at the surface of the particles $\textbf{w}_d^0$.
Regarding the higher-order moment of kinetic energy exchange same comments can be made except that these terms act as energy fluxes instead of sources. 
The relative importance of these three contribution depends highly on the particles' nature. 
To our knowledge, such a decomposition is not present in the literature except in \citep[Chapter 2]{scorsim2021particle} where they make similar considerations, but for solid spherical particles.
We recall that the stress integral $\pSavg{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}$ could include particles-particles close interaction as well, making our model consistent with the latter study.

As mentioned in \ref{ap:two-fluid_model}, to fully describe the averaged total energy of the continuous phase one must add at least a supplementary equation, either for $k_k$ or $e_k$.  
Under the hybrid formulation, the kinetic energy, pseudo turbulent energy, and internal energy equations read as,
\begin{align}
    \pddt (\phi_f \rho_fu_f^2/2)  
    + \div (
        \phi_f \rho_f\textbf{u}_fu_f^2/2
        + \textbf{u}_f \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^\text{eq}
    )
    = 
    \phi_f \rho_f \textbf{u}_f\cdot \textbf{g} 
    + \bm{\sigma}_f^\text{eq} : \grad \textbf{u}_f
    -  \textbf{u}_f\cdot 
        \pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}},
        \label{eq:dt_hybrid_u12}
        \\
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_k1}
    \pddt (\phi_f\rho_fk_f)  
    + \div (
        \phi_f\rho_fk_f\textbf{u}_f
        + \textbf{q}_f^\text{k} 
        )
    = 
    - \avg{\chi_f\bm{\sigma}_f^0 : \grad \textbf{u}_f^0}
    - \bm{\sigma}_f^\text{eq} : \grad \textbf{u}_f\nonumber
    - \pavg{ \textbf{u}_\alpha' \cdot \intS{  \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}\\
    + (\textbf{u}_f - \textbf{u}_p)\cdot \pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}} 
    - \pavg{ \intS{\textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}},
    \\
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_e1}
    \pddt (\phi_f\rho_fe_f)  
    + \div (
        \phi_f \rho_fe_f\textbf{u}_f
        +
        \textbf{q}_f^\text{e} 
        )
    = 
    \avg{\chi_f\bm{\sigma}_f^0 : \grad \textbf{u}_f^0}
    + \pSavg{{\textbf{q}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}},
\end{align}
respectively. 
One can verify that summing these three equations gives back \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_rhoE_f}. 
As \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_u12} and \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_e1} are rather similar to \ref{eq:dt_avg_uk2} and \ref{eq:dt_avg_ek} let us discuss \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_k1}. 
According to  \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_k1} we can stipulate that the pseudo turbulent energy $k_f$ in a dispersed two-phase flow is generated by five different sources. 
The one corresponds to the local scale energy dissipation that acts as a source term in the internal equation \eqref{eq:dt_hybrid_e1} (first term on the right-hand of \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_k1}). 
The second contribution corresponds to the macroscopic dissipation term which is the gradient of the mean fluid phase velocity contracted with the effective stress of the momentum equation.  
The last three exchange terms correspond to the generation of energy made by the particles through three distinct mechanisms, which are given by \ref{eq:exergysource}. 
Note that \eqref{eq:dt_hybrid_k1} is consistent with those in former studies \citep[Chapter 7]{morel2015mathematical}\citep[Chapter 2]{scorsim2021particle}\citet{kataoka1989basic}. 
However, the decomposition of the exchange term is not present \eqref{eq:exergysource}, and the expression of $\textbf{q}_f^k$ with the first moment of the exchange term has not been exposed in the literature in such generality.
Additionally, it seems that the identification of the effective stress $\bm\sigma^\text{eq}_f$ in the energy equations has not been remarked up to now.
At least in the \textit{hybrid formulation} of the energy equations. 
The energy exchange between the macroscopic, microscopic, and internal energy as well as the energy exchange between both phases, will be addressed later on.   


\subsection{Dispersed phase averaged equations}

Now, we turn our attention to the particle phase equations and closure terms. 

\subsubsection{Zeroth-order mass, momentum, and energy equation}
By applying the ensemble average on the particle phase equations, namely \ref{eq:dt_m_alpha}, \ref{eq:dt_p_alpha} and \ref{eq:dt_E_alpha_tot} we obtain the particle-phase averaged mass, momentum and energy equations, namely, 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_mp}
    \pddt \left(n_p m_p\right)
    + \div \left(n_pm_p\textbf{u}_p
    \right)
    = 
    0\\
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_up}
    \pddt \left(n_p m_p \textbf{u}_p\right)
    + \div \left(n_p
    m_p \textbf{u}_p \textbf{u}_p 
    + \bm{\sigma}_p^\text{eq}
    \right)
    = 
    n_p m_p \textbf{g}
    + \pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}},\\
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_Ep}
    \pddt(m_p n_pE_p^\text{tot})
    + \div(m_pn_p E_p^\text{tot} \textbf{u}_p 
    + \textbf{q}_p^\text{eq} 
    + \textbf{u}_p \cdot \bm{\sigma}_p^\text{eq})
    =  n_p m_p \textbf{u}_p\cdot  \textbf{g}
    % +  n_p ( \textbf{u}'_f \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d)_p^\Sigma
    -  \pSavg{\textbf{q}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}\nonumber\\
    + \textbf{u}_p \cdot\pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    + \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' \cdot\intS{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    + \pSavg{{\textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
\end{align}
where we have defined, 
\begin{align*}
    &\bm{\sigma}_p^\text{eq}
    =  m_p\pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha'\textbf{u}_\alpha'}
    &\textbf{q}_p^\text{eq}
    =\textbf{q}_p^\text{e} 
    +\textbf{q}_p^\text{k}  
    +\textbf{q}_p^\text{w}  
    \\
    &\textbf{q}_f^\text{e}
    = m_p \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' e_\alpha'} 
    &\textbf{q}_p^\text{k}
    = m_p \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' k_\alpha} 
    \\
    &\textbf{q}_p^\text{w}
    = 
     \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha'W_\alpha'}
    + \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' s_\alpha' \gamma}.
\end{align*}
Where we have introduced the averaged internal kinetic energy as $W_p = \pavg{W_\alpha}/n_p$, and recall that $W_\alpha = \intO{\rho_d  (w_d^0)^2/2}$. 
We recognize that these equations all possess the same exchange terms appearing in the fluid phase averaged equations but with opposite signs. 
However, note that in opposition to the fluid phase averaged equations, the first-order moments do not appear inside the fluxes of the particle equations. 
Consequently, under this form, only the fluctuating quantities play the role of dissipative fluxes. 
However, it is noteworthy to mention that, for example, the term, $ \pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}$ can be reformulated in certain situations as a mean drag force term plus a divergence of a stress, the latter represents particles-particles contact forces, \citet{jackson1997locally,zhang1997momentum,nott2011suspension,zhang2021ensemble}. 
Likewise, in some recent models, it is possible to expand the momentum exchange terms, as the sum of a \textit{binary force} and the divergence of a stress accounting for particles' long-range interaction forces \citep{zhang2021ensemble,nott2011suspension}. 
In opposition to the contact stress this long-range interaction stress appears on the particle and carrier fluid momentum conservation equation. 
Even though the latter stresses are indispensable to ensure the hyperbolicity of the two-phase flow equations \citep{fox2020hyperbolic}, we choose to not explicitly display these stresses. 

% \subsection{Secondary equations}

The particle-phase averaged total energy can also be decomposed into five different contributions, it yields 
\begin{equation*}
    n_p m_p E_p^\text{tot}(t) 
    = m_p n_p e_p 
    + n_p W_p
    + n_p s_p \gamma
    + m_p n_p k_p
    + m_p n_p (u_p)^2/2. 
    \label{eq:E_p_def}
\end{equation*}
Each of these terms represents: 
the mean particle's internal energy $e_p$; 
the averaged particle's internal kinetic energy $W_p$;
the averaged particle's surface energy $n_p s_p \gamma$;
the granular temperature $n_p k_p =\pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha \cdot\textbf{u}_\alpha}/2$;
and the kinetic energy of the mean particle phase velocity. 
If one wishes to solve for every component of the energy it is therefore needed to derive two supplementary equations. 
In \ref{ap:particles_eq} we have demonstrated how to derive the secondary equations for the energy of a single particle, see  \ref{eq:dt_e_alpha}, \ref{eq:dt_w2_alpha} and \ref{eq:dt_u2_alpha}. 
Thus, applying the average procedure on these equations one obtains, the particle averaged kinetic energy, internal kinetic energy, and internal energy equations, namely,
\begin{align}
    % &\pddt \left(n_p m_p u_p^2/ 2\right)
    % + \div \left(n_p
    % m_p u_p^2/ 2 \textbf{u}_p 
    % + \textbf{u}_p \cdot \bm{\sigma}_p^\text{eq}
    % \right)
    % = 
    % + \bm{\sigma}_p^\text{eq}  :\grad \textbf{u}_p
    % +  n_p v_p \textbf{u}_p \cdot 
    % \rho_d \textbf{g}
    % + n_p \textbf{u}_p \cdot (\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d)^\Sigma_p,\\
    &\pddt \left(\pavg{m_\alpha u_\alpha^2/2}\right)
    + \div \left(\pavg{m_\alpha u_\alpha^2/2} \textbf{u}_p 
    + \textbf{q}^k_p
    + \textbf{u}_p \cdot \bm{\sigma}_p^\text{eq}
    \right)
    = 
    n_p m_p \textbf{u}_p \cdot
    \textbf{g}\nonumber\\
    &+ \textbf{u}_p\cdot\pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    + \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha'\cdot\intS{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_u2p}
    \\
    &\pddt \left(n_p (W_p + s_p\gamma)\right)
    + \div 
    (n_p (W_p + \gamma s_p)
    \textbf{u}_p 
    +  \textbf{q}_p^\text{w}
    )
    = \nonumber\\
    &- \pOavg{{\bm{\sigma}_d^0 : \grad\textbf{u}_d^0}}
    + \pSavg{{\textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot  \textbf{n}_d}}
    % - \pavg{\dot{ s_\alpha}}
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_Wp}
    \\
    &\pddt \left(n_p m_p e_p\right)
    + \div \left(n_p
    m_p e_p \textbf{u}_p 
    +  \textbf{q}_p^\text{e}
    \right)
    = 
    \pOavg{{\bm{\sigma}_d^0 : \grad\textbf{u}_d^0}}\nonumber\\
    &- \pSavg{{\textbf{q}_f^0\cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_ep}
\end{align}
The center of mass kinetic energy can be further decomposed such as $\pavg{u_\alpha^2}/2 = n_p k_p + n_p u_p^2/2$. 
Then, to derive an equation for $k_p$ one must retrieve to \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_u2p} the dot product of \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_up} with $\textbf{u}_p$, which yields an equation for the mean kinetic energy and another for the granular temperature $k_p$, namely,
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_up2}
\pddt \left(n_p m_p u_p^2/ 2\right)
    + \div \left(n_p
    m_p u_p^2/ 2 \textbf{u}_p 
    + \textbf{u}_p \cdot \bm{\sigma}_p^\text{eq}
    \right)
    = 
    \bm{\sigma}_p^\text{eq}  :\grad \textbf{u}_p
    +  n_p m_p \textbf{u}_p \cdot 
     \textbf{g}
    + \textbf{u}_p \cdot \pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}},\\
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_kp}
    \pddt \left(n_p m_p k_p\right)
    + \div \left(n_p
    m_p k_p \textbf{u}_p 
    + \textbf{q}^k_p
    % + \textbf{u}_p \cdot \bm{\sigma}_p^\text{eq}
    \right)
    = 
    - \bm{\sigma}_p^\text{eq}  :\grad \textbf{u}_p
    + \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha'\cdot\intS{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}},
\end{align}
respectively.
\ref{eq:dt_hybrid_Wp}, \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_ep} and \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_up2} are discussed in \ref{ap:particles_eq} under a non-averaged form.
The only difference with the non-averaged form is the presence of the equivalent fluxes, $\textbf{q}_p^e$, $\textbf{q}_p^w$ and $\bm\sigma^\text{eq}_p$ which contain the covariance tensors. 
Additionally, one can verify that summing \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_ep}, \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_Wp} and \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_kp} and \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_up2} makes \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_Ep}.  
Now let us focus on the equation for granular temperature $k_p$ \eqref{eq:dt_hybrid_kp}. 

The usual way to derive the granular temperature equations is by the use of Liouville equations, see \citet[Chapter 7 and 9]{rao2008introduction} equation (7.75). 
To bridge the usual formulation of the equation for $k_p$ with the kinetic theory and our model, we remark that the term $\pSavg {\bm{\sigma}_d^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}$ takes in account both hydrodynamic forces and particle interaction forces. 
Consequently, the second term on the right-hand side of \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_kp} can be decomposed into a contribution due to particle-particle interactions and a contribution due to particle fluid interactions, the former is the dissipation term, see \citet[Chapter 7 and 9]{rao2008introduction} equation (7.75). 
Also, a term written as the divergence of a stress is included in kinetic theory, it is supposed to account for fluxes of granular agitation due to particle-particle elastic interactions. 
These terms can be recovered from the exchange term $\pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha'\cdot\intS{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}$ with a similar procedure than the derivation of the contact stress tensor, see \citet{scorsim2021particle}. 
Consequently, if we consider only particle-particle interaction terms such as in \citet{rao2008introduction} we obtain consistent results. 
Note that we have not made any hypothesis so far, consequently, \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_kp} itself is valid regardless of the particles' nature and concentration.
The hypotheses usually made in the kinetic theory framework are in fact only needed to derive the closure laws for the exchange term, $\pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha'\cdot\intS{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}$ not the whole equation. 

\subsubsection{First-order momentum and mass equations}

As is suggested in the previous section, the need for higher moments equations arises if one of the closure terms present in the previous set of equations is highly dependent on one of the moments of the particles. 
In our case, we suppose that the second-order description of the averaged shape, i.e. $\textbf{M}_p$, and a first-order description of velocity distribution, i.e. $\textbf{P}_p$,  is enough to express all closure terms. 
By applying the average operator on \ref{eq:dt_M_alpha},\ref{eq:dt_S_alpha} and \ref{eq:dt_mu_alpha}, one get the second-order moment of mass, and first-order moment of momentum symmetric and skew-symmetric parts, namely, 
\begin{align}
    \pddt \left(n_p \textbf{M}_p\right)
    + \div \left(
        n_p \textbf{u}_p \textbf{M}_p
    + \textbf{M}_p^\text{Re}
    \right)
    &=
    n_p2  \textbf{S}_p
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_Mp}\\
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_mup}
    \pddt \left(n_p \bm{\mu}_p\right)
    + \div \left(
    n_p \textbf{u}_p \bm{\mu}_p
    + \bm{\mu}_p^\text{Re}
    \right)
    &=
    \pSavg{\textbf{r}\times(\bm\sigma_f^0\cdot \textbf{n}_d)}
    \\

+ \textbf{S}_p^\text{Re}
\right)
&=
% -n_p v_p p_f \textbf{I}

    - \bm{\sigma}_d^0)
}
&-  \pSavg{\gamma (\bm\delta - \textbf{nn})},
\end{align}
respectively, where we have defined the fluctuaiton terms as $
 \textbf{M}_p^\text{Re}
 = \pavg{\textbf{M}_\alpha' \textbf{u}_\alpha'} $,  $ 
 \textbf{S}_p^\text{Re}
 = \pavg{\textbf{P}_\alpha' \textbf{u}_\alpha'}$ and $ 
 \bm{\mu}_p^\text{Re}
 = \pavg{\bm{\mu}_\alpha' \textbf{u}_\alpha'}
$.
Note that \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_Mp}  is an equation for the mean inertia matrix, it is therefore an equation for the mean orientation. 
Upon considering solid non-spherical particles this reduces reduce to the well-known Folgar-Tuker models. 
The closure terms will be discussed in more detail in the following. 

\section{Discussion on the energy exchanges}

Under this form, it is easy to observe the exchange terms which drive the energy transfer between each component of the total energy. 
Firstly, the source term $\bm{\sigma}_p^\text{Re} :\grad \textbf{u}_p$ appear in \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_up2} and \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_k1} with opposite sign. 
Consequently, macroscopic kinetic energy is transmitted to granular agitation through the macroscopic diffusion scalar: $\bm{\sigma}_p^\text{Re} :\grad \textbf{u}_p$. 
Then between \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_Wp} and \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_ep} we already observed that the source term is the dissipation term,  $\pOavg{\bm{\sigma}_d^0:\grad \textbf{u}_d^0}$.
However, note that no common term is present between \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_kp} and \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_Wp} which implies that there is no direct transfer of energy between the center of mass velocity fluctuation quantified by $k_p$ and the internal velocity fluctuation energy $W_p$. 
However, note that the transport equation for $k_f$, \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_k1}, contains the terms $\pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' \intS{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}$ and $\pSavg{\textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}$ which are also present in \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_kp} and \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_Wp}. 
Consequently, the energy transfer from granular agitation $k_p$ and the internal kinetic energy $W_p$ is done through the fluid phase pseudo turbulent kinetic energy. 
To summarize this quite complicated energy cascade between both phases and the different scales we propose the following diagram, see \ref{fig:energy}.

\end{figure}
% Consequently, the energy gain due to internal dissipation stress $\pOavg{\bm{\sigma}_d^0:\grad \textbf{u}_d^0}$ comes from the internal velocity fluctuation equation. 
In the literature, it is said that the transfer term between internal energy $e_p$ and the granular temperature $k_p$ is the \textit{dissipation rate} due to inelastic particle-particle collision present in \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_up2}, see for example \citet{fox2014multiphase,rao2008introduction}. 
However, in light of \ref{fig:energy} the energy gain due to  $\pOavg{\bm{\sigma}_d^0:\grad \textbf{u}_d^0}$ which is the \textit{dissipation rate} has no reason to be equal to the energy loss in \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_up2} represented by the term $\pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' \cdot \intS{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}$. 
Some energy is first transmitted to the fluid phase $k_p$, then some of this energy is transmitted to the internal kinetic energy $W_p$, which will induce viscous dissipation within the particle. 
In short, the internal kinetic energy is transformed into internal energy but by no means the \textit{dissipation rate} $\pOavg{\bm{\sigma}_d^0:\grad \textbf{u}_d^0}$ links between to the granular temperature $k_p$ and the internal energy of the particle phase $e_p$. 


\section{Conclusion}

Most work presented in this chapter is not original, nevertheless, some of it is new, thus it is worth making a brief summary of the findings made in this chapter. 

A point-by-point review of each section is proposed to highlight the key findings/ or not, that have been made in this work: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item  In \ref{sec:chap2local} we presented the local scale conservation equations, which do not introduce any new concepts. 
    However, we emphasized the correct derivation of the interface energy jump condition, a detail that is often overlooked in the literature. 
    \item In \ref{ap:particles_eq} we revisited the Lagrangian laws governing a single arbitrary fluid particle, drawing from Daniel Lhuillier's classes. 
    % However, the incorporation of surface tension properties into these equations appears to be entirely new. 
    Furthermore, the physical interpretation of the higher moments of mass and momentum, along with the incorporation of surface tension effects, is original and offers a framework for describing deformable particles. 
    \item Then in \ref{ap:two-fluid_model} we revisit the derivation of the two-fluid and single-fluid ensemble averaged equations for mass, momentum, and energy. 
    While most of this section was entirely exposed in the literature, the averaged interfacial energy jump condition \eqref{eq:dt_avg_gamma} seems new and has never been reported.
    \item In \ref{sec:symetric_stress} we investigated the symmetric property of the bulk stress tensor for a suspension subjected to an arbitrary body force field. 
    While this subject has been a matter of debate for a long time (since \citet{prosperetti2006stress}) we show that it should not have been, as demonstrated a while ago by \citet{lhuillier1996contribution}.
    As \citet{lhuillier1996contribution} we conclude that the bulk stress of a suspension is entirely symmetric in the absence of body torque, which is the case when the only body force field is the gravity. 
    The proof presented here is not original, since it is inspired from \citet{lhuillier1996contribution}.
    However, we provided a clearer physical explanation as we brought a detailed physical interpretation of the particle-averaged terms present in the bulk stress, which was not previously discussed.
    We hope to settle the recent debate present in the community \citep{dolata2020heterogeneous,zhou2020lamb}. 
    \item Finally, in \ref{sec:hybridchap2} we expose the \textit{Hybrid} form of the averaged two-phase flow equations. 
    This general derivation also permitted us to discuss the energy exchange present in a dispersed two-phase flow of arbitrary fluid particles; 
    It seems that, at least for the energy aspect, this derivation as well as the subsequent discussions is entirely original. 
    Indeed, even if similarities can be found in the literature for solid spherical particle energy equations, it is not the case for arbitrary fluid particles. 
\end{enumerate}
