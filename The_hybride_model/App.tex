Now that we reached a clear understanding of the mathematical structures of the averaged two-phase flow equations we start to expose the averaged set of equations which constitute the \textit{Hybrid model}. 
In this section we now consider the simplifying assumption exposed in \ref{ap:hypothesis} for the interfaces equations. 
As, mentioned in \ref{sec:two-fluid} we consider the mass, momentum and energy for the particles and continuous phase. 
Additionally, to describe the particle shape and momentum, one must consider the second moment of mass and first moment of momentum averaged equations. 
This, makes a total of 10 equations, 6 for the particle phase and 4 for the continuous phase.

\subsection{Continuous phase equations}

The equations for the carrier fluid are basically the same as in the classic two-fluid model derived in \ref{ap:two-fluid_model} except for the exchange terms of the form $\avg{\delta_I \ldots }$, that must be reformulated in terms of particle-averaged quantities to be consistent with the particle-phase equations \citep{jackson1997locally,zhang1994averaged}. 
This is done through the use of \ref{eq:f_exp} which help us to convert the exchange terms of the form of $\avg{\delta_I \ldots }$ appearing in \ref{eq:avg_dt_chi_f} to a series expansion of particle phase quantities. 
The continuous phase equations are easily derived using the generic expression : \ref{eq:avg_dt_chi_f}, and applying the preceding remarks to the interfacial term. 
The continuous phase-averaged mass, momentum and total energy equations yield, 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_rho}
    &\pddt (\phi_f \rho_f)  
    + \div (

    )

    )
    =

        % - \textbf{u}_f^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 
        % + \textbf{q}_f^0
        )
    = 
    \phi_f \rho_f\textbf{u}_f \cdot \textbf{g} 
    - \textbf{u}_p \cdot \pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}\nonumber \\
    &- \pavg{ \textbf{u}_\alpha' \cdot \intS{  \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    - \pavg{ \intS{\textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    + \pSavg{{\textbf{q}_f\cdot \textbf{n}_d}}

    % - \pavg{ \intS{\textbf{r}  \textbf{q}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    % ]
\end{align} 
where we defined the equivalent stress tensor $\bm{\sigma}_f^\text{eq}$ and energy flux $\textbf{q}^\text{eq}_f$ as,
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:sigma_eq_def}
    \bm{\sigma}_f^\text{eq}
    =& 
    \avg{\chi_f\rho_f\textbf{u}_f'\textbf{u}_f'}
    - \phi_f \bm{\sigma}_f%- n_p \textbf{M}_p
    - \pSavg{{\textbf{r}\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}\\
    \textbf{q}_f^\text{eq}
    =&\textbf{q}_f^\text{e} +\textbf{q}_f^\text{k}  \nonumber\\
    \textbf{q}_f^\text{e}
    =& \rho_f \avg{\chi_f \textbf{u}_f' e_f'} 
    + \phi_f\textbf{q}_f 
    +\pSavg{{\textbf{r}\textbf{q}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}} 
    \nonumber\\
    \textbf{q}_f^\text{k}
    =& \rho_f \avg{\chi_f \textbf{u}_f' k_f} 
    - \avg{\chi_f \textbf{u}_f' \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0}
    + (\textbf{u}_f - \textbf{u}_p)\cdot
    \pSavg{{\textbf{r}\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    \nonumber\\\nonumber&
    - \pavg{ \textbf{u}_\alpha' \cdot \intS{ \textbf{r} \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    - \pavg{ \intS{\textbf{r}\textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
\end{align}
It is clear that those equations yield essentially the same as the previous set of equations presented in \ref{ap:two-fluid_model}.
The only difference is the presence of additional fluxes inside $\bm{\sigma}^\text{eq}_f$ and $\textbf{q}^\text{eq}_f$. 
Especially, one can remark the presence of the first moments of external forces in $\bm{\sigma}^\text{eq}_f$. 
According to \ref{eq:f_exp} an infinite number of moments would be present however we chose to explicit only the first of the series for clarity. 
However, understand that the higher order moments are not necessarily negligible as demonstrated by \cite{jackson1997locally}.

Note that the terms $\pSavg{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}$ is the total components of the interphase drag force, including the mean pressure gradient of the fluid phase pressure. 
Likewise, $\pSavg{\textbf{r}\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}$ is the total averaged first moment of force traction, which include the mean fluid phase pressure $p_f$. 
The symmetric part of the latter term is responsible for the Einstein viscosity computed in dilute stokes flow regime \citep{guazzelli2011}. 
Thus, these  moments are of utmost importance in the averaged momentum equation.
Consequently, it is likely that these moments are non-negligible also for the energy averaged equation, to the authors' knowledge no study evacuated these moments in the literature. 

The exchange term in \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_rhoE_f} have been decomposed into three exchange terms.
Indeed, after taking the Taylor expansion of the interfacial term of \ref{eq:dt_avg_rhoE_k}, namely $\avg{\delta_I (\textbf{u}^0_d \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d)}$, around the particles center of mass we used the following decomposition on each of the moments :
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:exergysource}
    \pavg{ \intS{\textbf{u}^0_d \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    &= 
    \textbf{u}_p \cdot \pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    + \pavg{ \textbf{u}_\alpha' \cdot \intS{  \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    + \pavg{ \intS{\textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}},\\
    \pavg{ \intS{\textbf{r}\textbf{u}^0_d \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
   &= 
    \textbf{u}_p \cdot \pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    + \pavg{ \textbf{u}_\alpha' \cdot \intS{\textbf{r}  \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    + \pavg{ \intS{\textbf{r}\textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}},
\end{align}
where we have noticed that $\textbf{u}_d^0 = \textbf{u}_p + \textbf{u}_\alpha' +\textbf{w}_d^0$ according to \ref{eq:def_fluc_p} and to the definition of the \textit{inner velocity} of a particle $\textbf{w}_d^0$. 
In this form the contribution to the energy exchange is now clear. 
The first term on the right hands side of \ref{eq:exergysource} represents the work done by the mean phase relative motion, the second term is the work made by the resultants of the forces and individual particles fluctuating velocity, the last term represent the work made by the local force traction on the particle surface with the surface velocity relative to the particle center of mass velocity.
Same comments can be made for the first order moments. 
The relative importance of these three contribution depends highly on the particles' nature. 
To our knowledge, such a decomposition has not been seen in the literature except in \citep[Chapter 2]{scorsim2021particle} where they make similar consideration, but for solid spherical particles.
We recall that the stress integral $\pSavg{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}$ contains contact forces as well, making our model consistent with the latter study. 
\tb{maybe add the solid particle example }

The continuous phase averaged total energy can be further decomposed into three energy components, that is,  
\begin{align}
    E_k = e_k + k_k + u_k^2/2
    \label{eq:E_def}
\end{align}
where $k_k$ is the pseudo-turbulent kinetic energy defined as, $\phi_k k_k = \frac{1}{2}\avg{\chi_k \textbf{u}_k'\cdot \textbf{u}_k'}$. 
Each of the components of the total energy represent the averaged agitation at different scales. 
From molecular agitation which quantified by $e_k$, to the macroscopic scale agitation or kinematic energy $u_k^2$, and in between we find the pseudo turbulent energy $k_k$ which represents the local scale velocity fluctuation. 
To fully describe the averaged total energy one must add at least a supplementary equation either for $k_k$ or $e_k$. 
As discussed above \ref{eq:dt_avg_uk2}, \ref{eq:dt_avg_kk} and \ref{eq:dt_avg_ek} need to be reformulated consistently with the dispersed phase exchange term. 
Thus mean kinetic energy, pseudo turbulent energy and internal energy equation can be reformulated as, 
\begin{align}
    \pddt (\phi_f \rho_fu_f^2/2)  
    + \div (
        \phi_f \rho_f\textbf{u}_fu_f^2/2
        + \textbf{u}_f \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^\text{eq}
    )
    = 
     \bm{\sigma}_f^\text{eq} : \grad \textbf{u}_f
    + \phi_f \rho_f \textbf{u}_f\cdot \textbf{g} 
    -  \textbf{u}_f\cdot 
        \pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}} 
        % - \div 
        % \pSavg{{\textbf{r}\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}} 
        \\
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_k1}
    \pddt (\phi_f\rho_fk_f)  
    + \div (
        \phi_f\rho_fk_f\textbf{u}_f
        + \textbf{q}_f^\text{k} 
        )
    = 
    - \avg{\chi_f\bm{\sigma}_f^0 : \grad \textbf{u}_f^0}
    - \bm{\sigma}_f^\text{eq} : \grad \textbf{u}_f\nonumber
    - \pavg{ \textbf{u}_\alpha' \cdot \intS{  \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}\\
    + (\textbf{u}_f - \textbf{u}_p)\cdot \pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}} 
    - \pavg{ \intS{\textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}} 
    \\
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_e1}
    \pddt (\phi_f\rho_fe_f)  
    + \div (
        \phi_f \rho_fe_f\textbf{u}_f
        +
        \textbf{q}_f^\text{e} 
        )
    = 
    \avg{\chi_f\bm{\sigma}_f^0 : \grad \textbf{u}_f^0}
    + \pSavg{{\textbf{q}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}} 
\end{align}
Our form of the pseudo turbulent energy equation is consistent with the one of former studies \citep[Chapter 7]{morel2015mathematical}\citep[Chapter 2]{scorsim2021particle}\citet{kataoka1989basic}. 
However, the  decomposition of the exchange term isn't present and the expression of $\textbf{q}_f^k$, which gather the first moments of the work, has not been exposed in the literature in such a generality.
The energy exchange between the macroscopic microscopic and internal averaged energy as well as the energy exchange between both phases will be discussed.   


\subsection{Dispersed phase equations}

% Now, we turn our attention to the particle phase equations. 
% \tb{Do i put the surface in or out}
% \subsubsection{Primary equations}

By applying the ensemble average on \ref{eq:dt_m_alpha}, \ref{eq:dt_p_alpha} and \ref{eq:dt_E_alpha_tot} we obtain the particle averaged mass, momentum and energy equation, namely, 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_mp}
    \pddt \left(n_p m_p\right)
    + \div \left(n_pm_p\textbf{u}_p
    \right)
    = 
    0\\
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_up}
    \pddt \left(n_p m_p \textbf{u}_p\right)
    + \div \left(n_p
    m_p \textbf{u}_p \textbf{u}_p 
    + \bm{\sigma}_p^\text{eq}
    \right)
    = 
    n_p m_p \textbf{g}
    + \pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}},\\
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_Ep}
    \pddt(m_p n_pE_p^\text{tot})
    + \div(m_pn_p E_p^\text{tot} \textbf{u}_p 
    + \textbf{q}_p^\text{eq} 
    + \textbf{u}_p \cdot \bm{\sigma}_p^\text{eq})
    =  n_p m_p \textbf{u}_p\cdot  \textbf{g}
    % +  n_p ( \textbf{u}'_f \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d)_p^\Sigma
    -  \pSavg{\textbf{q}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}\nonumber\\
    + \textbf{u}_p \cdot\pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    + \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' \cdot\intS{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    + \pSavg{{\textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
\end{align}
where we have defined, 
\begin{align*}
    &\bm{\sigma}_p^\text{eq}
    =  m_p\pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha'\textbf{u}_\alpha'}
    &\textbf{q}_p^\text{eq}
    =\textbf{q}_p^\text{e} 
    +\textbf{q}_p^\text{k}  
    +\textbf{q}_p^\text{w}  
    \\
    &\textbf{q}_f^\text{e}
    = m_p \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' e_\alpha'} 
    &\textbf{q}_p^\text{k}
    = m_p \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' k_\alpha} 
    \\
    &\textbf{q}_p^\text{w}
    = 
     \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha'W_\alpha'}
    + \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' s_\alpha' \gamma}.
\end{align*}
We have introduced the internal kinetic energy with $n_pW_p = \pOavg{{\rho_d  (w_d^0)^2/2}}$. 
We recognize that these equations posses indeed the exchange terms corresponding to the fluid phase averaged equations but with opposite sign. 
However, note that in opposition to the fluid phase averaged equations, the first order moments do not appear inside the fluxes of the particles equations. 
Consequently, only the fluctuating quantities plays the role of dissipative fluxes. 
It is noteworthy to mentions that in the total drag force term, $ \pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}$ the divergence of a stress is hidden, teh latter represent particles-particles contact forces, \citet{jackson1997locally,zhang1997momentum}. 
One may argue that this is not consistent since this stress would also appear on the fluid phase momentum equation upon the development of the term $\pSavg{\bm{\sigma}_f^0\cdot\textbf{n}_d}$. 
However, this is made consistent if one notice that contact force stress is also present in the first moment $\pSavg{\textbf{r}\bm{\sigma}_f^0\cdot\textbf{n}_d}$ but with opposed sign. 
Likewise, note that in some recent models it is possible to expands the momentum exchange terms, as the sum of a \textit{binary force} and the divergence of a stress accounting for particles' long range interaction forces \citep{zhang2021ensemble,nott2011suspension}. 
In opposition to the contact stress, this long range interaction stress, appears on the particle and carrier fluid momentum conservation equation. 
Eventhrougth, the latter stress has been shown to be indispensable to ensure the hypertonicity of the two phase flow equations\citep{fox2020hyperbolic}, we choose to not explicitly display this kind of stresses for succinctness. 

% \subsubsection{Secondary equations}

The particle averaged total energy can be decomposed in the similar way than the continuous averaged total energy \ref{eq:E_def}. 
The decomposition is somewhat more involving than the continuous phase and reads as, 
\begin{equation*}
    n_p m_p E_p^\text{tot}(t) 
    = m_p n_p e_p 
    + n_p W_p
    + n_p s_p \gamma
    + m_p n_p k_p
    + m_p n_p (u_p)^2/2
    \label{eq:E_p_def}
\end{equation*}
The total energy of the particle phase is made of :
the mean particle's internal energy $e_p$; 
the averaged particle's internal kinetic energy $W_p$;
the averaged particle's surface energy $n_p s_p \gamma$;
the granular temperature $n_p k_p =\pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha \cdot\textbf{u}_\alpha}/2$;
and the kinetic energy of the mean particle phase velocity. 
% The mean surface energy $n_p s_p \gamma$ is treated as a source terms in the following equations, that is why it doesn't appear in \ref{eq:E_p_def}.  
If one wish to solve for every component of the energy it is therefore needed to derive two supplementary equation. 
Applying the average procedure on \ref{eq:dt_e_alpha}, \ref{eq:dt_w2_alpha} and \ref{eq:dt_u2_alpha} one can derive an equation for the particle averaged internal energy, internal kinetic energy and mean kinetic energy, it yields, 
\begin{align}
    % &\pddt \left(n_p m_p u_p^2/ 2\right)
    % + \div \left(n_p
    % m_p u_p^2/ 2 \textbf{u}_p

    % \rho_d \textbf{g}
    % + n_p \textbf{u}_p \cdot (\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d)^\Sigma_p,\\
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_u2p}
    \pddt \left(\pavg{m_\alpha u_\alpha^2/2}\right)
    + \div \left(\pavg{m_\alpha u_\alpha^2/2} \textbf{u}_p

    + \textbf{u}_p\cdot\pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    + \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha'\cdot\intS{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    \\
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_Wp}
    \pddt \left(n_p (W_p + s_p\gamma)\right)
    + \div 
    (n_p (W_p + \gamma s_p)
    \textbf{u}_p 
    +  \textbf{q}_p^\text{w}
    )
    = 
    - \pOavg{{\bm{\sigma}_d^0 : \grad\textbf{u}_d^0}}
    + \pSavg{{\textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot  \textbf{n}_d}}
    % - \pavg{\dot{ s_\alpha}}
    \\
    \pddt \left(n_p m_p e_p\right)
    + \div \left(n_p
    m_p e_p \textbf{u}_p

    \right)
    = 
    + \pOavg{{\bm{\sigma}_d^0 : \grad\textbf{u}_d^0}}
    - \pSavg{{\textbf{q}_f^0\cdot \textbf{n}_d}}
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_ep}
\end{align}
The center of mass kinetic energy can be further decomposed such as $\pavg{u_\alpha^2}/2 = n_p k_p + n_p u_p^2/2$. 
Then, to derive an equation for $k_p$ one must retrieve to \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_u2p} the dot product of \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_up} with $\textbf{u}_p$, which eventually yields an equation for the mean kinetic energy and another for the granular temperature $k_p$, namely,
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_up2}
\pddt \left(n_p m_p u_p^2/ 2\right)
    + \div \left(n_p
    m_p u_p^2/ 2 \textbf{u}_p 
    + \textbf{u}_p \cdot \bm{\sigma}_p^\text{eq}
    \right)
    = 
    \bm{\sigma}_p^\text{eq}  :\grad \textbf{u}_p
    +  n_p m_p \textbf{u}_p \cdot 
     \textbf{g}
    + \textbf{u}_p \cdot \pSavg{{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}},\\
    \label{eq:dt_hybrid_kp}
    \pddt \left(n_p m_p k_p\right)
    + \div \left(n_p
    m_p k_p \textbf{u}_p 
    + \textbf{q}^k_p
    % + \textbf{u}_p \cdot \bm{\sigma}_p^\text{eq}
    \right)
    = 
    - \bm{\sigma}_p^\text{eq}  :\grad \textbf{u}_p
    + \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha'\cdot\intS{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}},
\end{align}
respectively.
Since equation \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_Wp}, \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_ep} and \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_u2p} are discussed in \ref{ap:particles_eq} let's focus on the granular temperature equation. 
The usual way to derive the granular temperature equations is by the use of kinetic theory, see \citet[Chapter 7 and 9]{rao2008introduction} equation (7.75). 
To bridge the usual formulation of the equation for $k_p$ with the kinetic theory and our model, we remark that the term $\pSavg {\bm{\sigma}_d^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}$ takes in account both hydrodynamic forces and particle interaction forces. 
Consequently, the second term on the right hands side of \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_kp} can be decomposed into a contribution due to particle-particle interactions and a contribution due to particle fluid interactions, the former is the dissipation term of see \citet[Chapter 7 and 9]{rao2008introduction} equation (7.75). 
Also, a term written as the divergence of a stress is in fact included in kinetic theory, it is supposed to account for fluxes of granular agitation due to particle-particle elastic interactions. 
This terms can be recovered from the exchange term $\pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha'\cdot\intS{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}$ with a similar procedure than the derivation of the contact stress tensor, see \citet{scorsim2021particle}. 
Consequently, if we consider only particles-particles interaction terms uch as in \citet{rao2008introduction} we obtain consistent results. 
Notice that we did not make any hypothesis so far, consequently, \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_kp} itself is valid regardless of the particles nature and concentration.
The hypothesis made in kinetic theory are in fact needed to derive the closure for the exchange term, $\pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha'\cdot\intS{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}$. 

\subsection{The energy exchanges}

One can verify that summing \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_ep}, \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_Wp} and \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_kp} and \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_up2} makes \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_Ep}.  
Under this form it is easy to observe the exchange terms which drive the energy transfer between each component of the total energy. 
Firstly, the source term $\bm{\sigma}_p^\text{Re} :\grad \textbf{u}_p$ appear in \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_up2} and \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_k1} with opposite sign. 
Consequently, macroscopic kinetic energy is transmitted to granular agitation through the macroscopic diffusion scalar : $\bm{\sigma}_p^\text{Re} :\grad \textbf{u}_p$. 
Then between \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_Wp} and \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_ep} we already observed that the source terms is the dissipation term,  $\pOavg{\bm{\sigma}_d^0:\grad \textbf{u}_d^0}$.
However, note that no common term is present between \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_kp} and \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_Wp} which implies that there is no direct transfer of energy between the center of mass velocity fluctuation quantified by $k_p$ and the internal velocity fluctuation energy $W_p$. 
However, notice that the transport equation for $k_f$, \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_k1}, contains the terms $\pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' \intS{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}$ and $\pSavg{\textbf{w}_d^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}$ which are also present in \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_kp} and \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_Wp}. 
Consequently, the energy transfer from granular agitation $k_p$ and the internal kinetic energy $W_p$ is done through the fluid phase pseudo turbulent kinetic energy. 
To summarize this quite complicated energy cascade between both phases and the different scales we propose the following diagram, see \ref{fig:energy}.

% Consequently, the energy gain due to internal dissipation stress $\pOavg{\bm{\sigma}_d^0:\grad \textbf{u}_d^0}$ comes from the internal velocity fluctuation equation. 
In the literature, it is said that the transfer terms between internal energy $e_p$ and the granular temperature $k_p$ is the \textit{dissipation rate} due to inelastic particle-particle collision present in \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_up2}, see for example \citet{fox2014multiphase,rao2008introduction}. 
However, in light of \ref{fig:energy} the energy gain due to  $\pOavg{\bm{\sigma}_d^0:\grad \textbf{u}_d^0}$ which is the \textit{dissipation rate} has no reason to be equal to the energy loss in \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_up2} represented by the term $\pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' \intS{\bm{\sigma}_f^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_d}}$. 
In fact some energy is first transmitted to the fluid phase $k_p$, then some of this energy is transmitted to the internal kinetic energy $W_p$, which will induce viscous dissipation within the particle. 
In short, the internal kinetic energy is transformed into internal energy but by no means the \textit{dissipation rate} $\pOavg{\bm{\sigma}_d^0:\grad \textbf{u}_d^0}$ makes the link between to the granular temperature $k_p$ and the internal energy of the particle phase $e_p$. 

\subsection{The first order momentum and mass equations}

As it is suggested in the previous section, the needs for higher moments equations arise if one of the closure terms present in the previous set of equation is highly dependent on one of the moments of the particles. 
In our case we suppose that the second order description of the averaged shape, i.e. $\textbf{M}_p$, and a first order description of velocity distribution, i.e. $\textbf{P}_p$,  is enough to express all closure terms. 
By applying the average operator on \ref{eq:dt_M_alpha},\ref{eq:dt_S_alpha} and \ref{eq:dt_mu_alpha}, one get the second order moment of mass, and first order moment of momentum symmetric and skew symmetric parts, namely, 
\begin{align}

\\
\label{eq:dt_hybrid_mup}
\pddt \left(n_p \bm{\mu}_p\right)
+ \div \left(
n_p \textbf{u}_p \bm{\mu}_p
+ \bm{\mu}_p^\text{Re}
\right)
&=
\pSavg{\textbf{r}\times(\bm\sigma_f^0\cdot \textbf{n}_d)}
\end{align}
respectively, where we have defined the fluctuaiton terms as $
 \textbf{M}_p^\text{Re}
 = \pavg{\textbf{M}_\alpha' \textbf{u}_\alpha'} $,  $ 
 \textbf{S}_p^\text{Re}
 = \pavg{\textbf{P}_\alpha' \textbf{u}_\alpha'}$ and $ 
 \bm{\mu}_p^\text{Re}
 = \pavg{\bm{\mu}_\alpha' \textbf{u}_\alpha'}
$.
Note many comments can be made about these equations as they have been already treated in \ref{sec:Lagrangian}. 
However, it is interesting to discuss the case of infinitely rigid particles where the internal velocity is defined by $\textbf{w}_d^0 = \bm\Omega_\alpha \cdot \textbf{r}$ and the particle internal stress is undefined. 
In this case \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_Mp} and \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_mup} might be used to solve for the orientation and angular velocity of the particles. 
Therefore, \ref{eq:dt_hybrid_Sp} seems to be redundant and is in practice never used. 
In fact this equation can be used to determine the averaged stress, $\pOavg{\bm{\sigma}_d}$ in terms of the particles' kinetic properties. 
Knowing the internal stress of the particles, and the constitutive law of the solid material, one is able to compute the averaged deformation of the particle. 
Once the deformation is obtained, one is able to validate, or not, the assumption of infinitely rigid particles made at the origin.
