\section{Hybrid description of the two phases}
\label{sec:averaged_eq}

Two distinct descriptions can be applied to the dispersed phase, while only one description is applicable to the continuous phase. 
In this section, %we derive averaged equations for the dispersed phase using Lagrangian conservation laws. 
%Following this, 
we discuss the link between  the phase averaged equations for the dispersed phase presented in \ref{sec:two-fluid} and the particle or Lagrangian averaged equations presented in \ref{sec:Lagrangian}.


%Two different descriptions are possible for the dispersed phase while one is available for the fluid phase. 
%In this part we first derive averaged equations for the dispersed phase based on Lagrangian conservation laws. 
%Then we provide a complete discussion regarding the equivalence between the "lagrangian" averaged equations for the dispersed phase and the averaged equations governing the dispersed phase presented in \ref{sec:two-fluid}. 
%based on 
%the set of equations just derived and the averaged equations governing the dispersed phase presented in \ref{sec:two-fluid}.
