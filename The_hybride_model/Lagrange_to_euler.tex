Two distinct descriptions can be applied to the dispersed phase, while only one description is applicable to the fluid phase. 
In this section, we derive averaged equations for the dispersed phase using Lagrangian conservation laws. 
Following this, we  discuss the equivalence between the particle or Lagrangian averaged equations for the dispersed phase and the averaged equations for the dispersed phase presented in \ref{sec:two-fluid}.


%Two different descriptions are possible for the dispersed phase while one is available for the fluid phase. 
%In this part we first derive averaged equations for the dispersed phase based on Lagrangian conservation laws.

\subsection{Particle-averaged equations}

In the preceding section, we have described the dispersed phase using a Lagrangian framework. 
However, to ensure consistency with the Eulerian conservation equations that describe the continuous phase, it is necessary to extend the Lagrangian equations to an Eulerian description. 
The approach presented here follows the methodology pioneered by \citep{lhuillier1992ensemble}.
%In the last section, we have described the dispersed phase within a Lagrangian framework.
%However, to be consistent with the Eulerian conservation equations used to describe the continuous phase, we need to extend the Lagrangian equations to an Eulerian description. 
%The strategy exposed here follow the approach pionnered by \citep{lhuillier1992ensemble}.
%In order to achieve this,
We introduce the function $\delta_\alpha$, which is defined as follows, 
\begin{align}
    \delta_\alpha(\textbf{x},\textbf{x}_\alpha(t,\FF)) 
    = \delta(\textbf{x}-\textbf{x}_\alpha(t,\FF)),
    \label{eq:delta_alpha}
\end{align}
where $\delta$ is the Dirac function.
Note that we explicitly note the arguments $(t,\FF)$ to highlight that the position of the particle $\alpha$ is a function of time and of the flow configuration $\FF$.
Applying the chain rule yields \citep{lhuillier1998}%we may write the partial time derivative of $\delta_\alpha$ can be written as
%\begin{equation}
%\frac{\partial \delta_\alpha(\textbf{x},\textbf{x}_\alpha(t,\FF))}{\partial t} 
%=  \frac{\partial \textbf{x}_\alpha}{\partial t} 
%\cdot \frac{\partial \delta_\alpha}{\partial \textbf{x}_\alpha}(\textbf{x},\textbf{x}_\alpha(t,\FF)) .
%\end{equation}
%This leads to the following expression, 
\begin{equation}
    \pddt \delta_\alpha
    + \div (\textbf{u}_\alpha  \delta_\alpha)
    =0,
    \label{eq:dt_delta_alpha}
\end{equation}
where we used the identity, $\frac{\partial \delta_\alpha}{\partial \textbf{x}_\alpha}  = -\grad \delta_\alpha$ and the fact that $\textbf{u}_\alpha(t,\FF)$ is not a function of $\textbf{x}$. 
\ref{eq:dt_delta_alpha} does not apply in scenarios where topological changes occur, such as break-up or coalescence events. 
In these cases, a source term can be introduced on the right-hand side of \ref{eq:dt_delta_alpha}, similar to the approach used in population balance equations, to account for the birth or death of particles \citep{randolph2012theory}.
%It should be noted that \ref{eq:dt_delta_alpha} is not applicable if changes in topology, such as break-up or coalescence events, occur.
%In such cases it is possible, as it is done in population balance equations, to include a source term on the RHS of \ref{eq:dt_delta_alpha} to account for particle birth or death. 
%Multiplying each Lagrangian quantities $\text q_\alpha$ by $\delta_\alpha$ yields the field $\text q_\alpha(t,\FF)\delta_\alpha(\textbf{x},t,\FF)$, which is defined over the entire domain $\Omega$.
%Likewise, for any derivative of Lagrangian quantities, such as $\ddt \text q_\alpha$, we define its corresponding Eulerian field by multiplying $\ddt \text q_\alpha$ with $\delta_\alpha$ and show that :
%where we have used the fact that $\text q_\alpha(t,\FF)$ and $\textbf{u}_\alpha(t,\FF)$ are not function of \textbf{x}, and we made use of \ref{eq:dt_delta_alpha}.
%Now let us consider a domain containing $N$ particles.
%We define what we call the \textit{particle field} of a quantity $\text q_\alpha$, as the sum of the $\delta_\alpha \text q_\alpha$ over all particles in the flow, namely $\displaystyle\sum_{\alpha=0}^N \delta_\alpha \text q_\alpha$.
%Notice that \ref{eq:dt_delta_alpha_q_alpha} remains valid for a sum of fields since derivative and sum operators commute.
Consider a domain containing $N$ particles. We define the \textit{particle field} for a quantity $\text q_\alpha$​ as the sum of $\delta_\alpha \text q_\alpha$ over all particles within the domain, expressed by $\displaystyle\sum_{\alpha=0}^N \delta_\alpha \text q_\alpha$​. 
Note that the formula given by \ref{eq:dt_delta_alpha_q_alpha} remains valid for the sum of such fields, since the operations of differentiation and summation commute.
%In the objective of obtaining averaged equations for the dispersed phase, we introduce the average of $\text q_\alpha$ as  
To obtain the averaged equations for the dispersed phase, we define the particle average of $\text q_\alpha$​ as
\begin{equation}
     n_p \text q_p(\textbf{x},t) = \avg{\sum_\alpha\delta_\alpha \text q_\alpha},
     \label{eq:p_avg}
\end{equation}
where, $n_p(\textbf{x},t) = \avg{\sum_\alpha \delta_\alpha}$ is the probability density of finding a particle center of mass in the infinitesimal volume $d\textbf{x}$ around \textbf{x}, and $\text q_p(\textbf{x},t)$ is the average of $\text q_\alpha$ conditionally on the presence of a particle at \textbf{x} and time $t$. 
To simplify the notations, we consider the shorthand \citep{lhuillier1998},
\begin{equation*}
    \sum_\alpha \delta_\alpha \to \delta_p, 
\end{equation*}
such that $\pavg{\text q_\alpha}=\avg{\sum_\alpha \delta_\alpha \text q_\alpha}=n_p\text q_p$.
Note that we used the subscript $_p$ on $\text q_p$ to denote that this represents a particle-averaged field, initially derived from Lagrangian quantities. 
%Furthermore, in view of equation   
Additionally, in light of \ref{eq:def_fluctu} we define the fluctuating part of a particle field $\text q_p$ as
\begin{equation}
    \text q_\alpha' = \text q_\alpha - \text q_p. 
    \label{eq:def_fluc_p}
\end{equation}

To derive the averaged equations for the particle phase, we begin by noting that multiplying a Lagrangian quantity $\text q_\alpha$​ by $\delta_\alpha$​ yields the corresponding Eulerian field  $\text q_\alpha(t,\FF)\delta_\alpha(\textbf{x},t,\FF)$, which is defined throughout the entire domain $\Omega$. 
Similarly, for any derivative of a Lagrangian quantity, such as $\ddt \text q_\alpha$​, the corresponding Eulerian field is defined by multiplying $\ddt \text q_\alpha$ with $\delta_\alpha$.
%This can be expressed as
Given that $\text q_\alpha(t,\FF)$ and $\textbf{u}_\alpha(t,\FF)$ do not depend on \textbf{x}, and by using Equation \ref{eq:dt_delta_alpha}, we obtain
\begin{equation}
    \delta_\alpha \ddt \text q_\alpha
    = \pddt (\delta_\alpha \text q_\alpha)
    + \div (\delta_\alpha \text q_\alpha \textbf{u}_\alpha).
    \label{eq:dt_delta_alpha_q_alpha}
\end{equation}
Multiplying \ref{eq:dt_q_alpha_tot} and \ref{eq:dt_Q_alpha_tot} by $\delta_\alpha$, using \ref{eq:dt_delta_alpha_q_alpha} and applying the ensemble average (\ref{eq:avg}), yields
\begin{align}
    \pddt (n_p\text Q_p)
    + \div (n_p \text Q_p \textbf{u}_p + \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' \text Q_\alpha'})
    = \pOavg{ s_d^0 }
    + \pSavg{ s_I^0 }\nonumber\\
    + \pSavg{ \left[\mathbf{\Phi}_f^0 + f_f^0 (\textbf{u}_\Gamma^0-\textbf{u}_f^0) \right] \cdot \textbf{n}_d },
    \label{eq:avg_dt_dq_alpha_tot}\\
    \pddt (n_p\textbf{Q}_p^{(1)})
    + \div \left(n_p \textbf{Q}_p^{(1)} \textbf{u}_p + \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' \textbf{Q}_\alpha^{(1)'}}\right)
    =\pOavg{ \left(
        \textbf{r} s_d^0         
        + f_d^0  \textbf{w}_d^0 
        - \mathbf{\Phi}_d^0
    \right) }\nonumber\\
    + \pSavg{ \left(
        \textbf{r}s_\Gamma^0
        + f_\Gamma^0 \textbf{w}_\Gamma^0
        - \mathbf{\Phi}_{\Gamma||}^0
    \right) }
    + \pSavg{ \textbf{r} \left[
        \mathbf{\Phi}_f^0
        + f_f^0 (\textbf{u}_\Gamma^0-\textbf{u}_f^0)
    \right]\cdot \textbf{n}_d  }.
    \label{eq:avg_dt_dQ_alpha_tot}
\end{align}
The derivation of the higher moment particle-averaged equations is provided in \ref{ap:Moments_equations}.
The only fluxes appearing in \ref{eq:avg_dt_dq_alpha_tot} and \ref{eq:avg_dt_dQ_alpha_tot} are the fluctuation tensors $\pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' \text q_\alpha'}$ and $\pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' \textbf{Q}_\alpha'}$. 
Therefore, the non-convective fluxes $\bm\Phi_d^0$ and $\bm\Phi_I^0$ do not play the role of macroscopic fluxes, as it is the case in \ref{eq:avg_dt_chi_f} and \ref{eq:avg_dt_delta_f}. Instead, they act as source terms in the first moment and higher moment equations. 
This distinction is the main structural differences between the Kinetic-like model (\ref{eq:avg_dt_dq_alpha_tot} and \ref{eq:avg_dt_dQ_alpha_tot}) and the two-phase flow model (\ref{eq:avg_dt_chi_f} and \ref{eq:avg_dt_delta_f}). 
In this study, \ref{eq:avg_dt_chi_f} and \ref{eq:avg_dt_delta_f} are referred to as the phase-averaged equations, while \ref{eq:avg_dt_dq_alpha_tot} and \ref{eq:avg_dt_dQ_alpha_tot} are called the particle-averaged equations.
