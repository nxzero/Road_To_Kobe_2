Most of the material presented in this Section is not original, we use it mainly as
a reminder and an opportunity to present quantities and notations that will be
used later on.

    \label{fig:Scheme}
\end{figure}
We consider a system consisting of two phases, separated by a sharp interface $\Sigma(t)$ which evolves over time. 
Each phase subdomain is denoted $\Omega_1(t)$ and $\Omega_2(t)$ for the continuous phase ($1$) and the dispersed phase ($2$) respectively (see \ref{fig:Scheme}). 
The mathematical and physical definition of $\Sigma(t)$ is by no means straightforward, therefore, the interested reader is refereed to \cite{bothe2022sharp} to have a deeper understanding of sharp interface modeling. 
The entire domain, denoted as $\Omega$, is defined as the union of $\Omega_1$, $\Omega_2$, and $\Sigma$.
To track the position of the phase indexed $k$ and the interface, we introduce the phase indicator function and the interface indicator function, 
\begin{align}
    \chi_k(\textbf{x},t) &=  \left\{
      \begin{tabular}{cc}
        $1 \;\text{if} \;\textbf{x} \in \Omega_k(t)$\\
        $0 \;\text{if} \;\textbf{x} \notin \Omega_k(t)$
      \end{tabular}
      \right.
      \text{for $k = 1,2$},
      \label{eq:PIF}\\
    \delta_I(\textbf{x},t) &=  \left\{
      \begin{tabular}{cc}
        $1 \;\text{if} \;\textbf{x} \in \Sigma(t)$\\
        $0 \;\text{if} \;\textbf{x} \notin \Sigma(t)$
      \end{tabular}
      \right.,
      \label{eq:PIF_I}
\end{align}
respectively. 
In the following, we omit the time and position arguments of $\chi_k$ and $\delta_I$. 

\subsection{Local conservation equations}
\label{sec:local_eq}

For the purpose of clarity, we only consider the specific case of the mass, momentum and energy conservation equations for a buoyant dispersed two phase flow.
Besides, we restrict the examples to the cases without mass transfer.

\subsubsection{Inside the volumes}
Within phase $k$, we note $\rho_k$ the density, $\textbf{u}_k^0$ the local velocity and $E_k^0$ the local total energy per units of mass.
All over the domain $\Omega_k(t)$ the mass, momentum and total energy obey these conservation laws :
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:dt_rho}
    \pddt \rho_k  
    + \div (
        \rho_k\textbf{u}_k^0
    )
    &= 
    0\\
    \label{eq:dt_rhou_k}
    \pddt (\rho_k\textbf{u}_k^0)  
    + \div (
        \rho_k\textbf{u}_k^0\textbf{u}_k^0
        - \bm{\sigma}_k^0 
    )
    &= 
    \rho_k \textbf{g}\\
    \label{eq:dt_rhoE_k}
    \pddt (\rho_kE_k^0)  
    + \div (
        \rho_kE_k^0\textbf{u}_k^0
        + \textbf{q}_k^0
        - \textbf{u}_k^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_k^0 
        )
    &= 
    \textbf{u}_k^0 \cdot \textbf{g}  \rho_k
\end{align} 
All along this work the continuous phase will be considered as Newtonian fluid thus, $\bm{\sigma}_1^0 = - p_1^0 \textbf{I} + \bm{\tau}_1^0$ where $\bm{\tau}_1^0$ is the Newtonian stress tensor with $p_1 ^0$ the local pressure and $\bm{\tau}_1^0 = \mu_1[\grad \textbf{u}_1^0+(\grad \textbf{u}_1^0)^T]$ the shear rate. 
The vector $\textbf{q}_k^0$ represent the thermal energy flux and is often model with a Fourier law : $\textbf{q}_k^0 = -\lambda \grad T_k^0$ where $T_k$ is the temperature and $\textbf{g}$ is the acceleration of gravity which will be the only body force in the present problem. 
The total energy is decomposed such as, $E_k^0 = e_k^0 + (u_k^0)^2/2$ where  $e_k^0$ is the internal energy which represent the molecular agitation and $(u_k^0)^2/2$ is the kinetic energy per unit of mass.
This decomposition leads us to two independent equation for $e_k$ and $u_k$, 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:dt_rhou_k2}
    \pddt [\rho_k(u_k^0)^2]  
    + \div [\rho_k(u_k^0)^2\textbf{u}_k^0/2 - \textbf{u}_k^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_k^0]
    &=
    \rho_k\textbf{u}_2^0 \cdot \textbf{g}  
    -  \bm{\sigma}_k^0 : \grad \textbf{u}_k^0 
    \\
    \label{eq:dt_rhoe_k}
    \pddt (\rho_ke_k^0)  
    + \div (
        \rho_ke_k^0\textbf{u}_k^0
        + \textbf{q}_k^0
        )
    &= 
    \bm{\sigma}_k^0 : \grad \textbf{u}_k^0
\end{align} 
where we can observe that the term $\bm{\sigma}_k^0 : \grad \textbf{u}_k^0$ called the dissipation terms which appears with opposite sign in both conservation equation, which indicate that it plays the role of the transfer term across scales transfer which convert kinetic energy into internal energy. 
By the use of thermodynamics equilibrium laws one can show that from the internal energy equation one can derive an equation for the local temperature \citet{ishii2010thermo}.
In this work we display the internal energy equation for completeness, no additional discussion will be given on to quantity. 
We rather focus on the fluid and particle kinetic energy. 
Therefore, not much discussion will be provided on the internal energy equation. 


\subsubsection{On interfaces}
The interface mass and momentum two-dimensional conservation equation which can be viewed as the jump condition at the interface are well established.
However, the energy conservation law jump condition at the interface is less employed.
In the most general case the mass, momentum and energy surface equations can be written as, 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:dt_rhoI}
    \pddt (\rho_I)  
    + \divI (
    \rho_I\textbf{u}_I^0
    -\sigma \textbf{I}_{||} )
    0
    &= 
    \Jump{
        \rho_k (\textbf{u}_I - \textbf{u}_k)
        % \mathbf{T}_k
    }\\
    \label{eq:dt_rhoIu_I}
    \pddt (\rho_I\textbf{u}_I^0)  
    + \divI (
    \rho_I\textbf{u}_I^0\textbf{u}_I^0
    - \bm{\sigma}_{I||}^0)
    &= 
    \rho_I \textbf{g}
    - \Jump{
        % \rho_k \textbf{u}_k (\textbf{u}_I - \textbf{u}_k)
        \mathbf{T}_k
    }\\
    \label{eq:dt_rhoIE_I}
    \pddt (\rho_I\sigma)  
    + \divI (
        \rho_I\sigma\textbf{u}_I^0
        - \textbf{u}_I^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_I^0 
        + \textbf{q}_{I||}^0
        )
    &= 
    \textbf{u}_k^0 \cdot \textbf{g}  \rho_I
    - \Jump{\textbf{u}_k^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_k^0 - \textbf{q}_k^0}
\end{align} 
where, $\rho_I$ is the mass per unit of surface of the interface, $\textbf{u}_I^0$ is the local velocity of the interface $\Sigma(t)$, $\bm{\sigma}_I^0$ is the local momentum diffusive flux of surface and $\textbf{q}_I^0$ is the local internal energy diffusive flux of surface. 
We introduced the surface divergence operator defined as $\divI ()= (\textbf{I}-\textbf{nn})\cdot \div ()$, which correspond to the divergence operator projected on $\Sigma(t)$. 
Throughout this work we use the subscript  $_{||}$ to indicate the projection of a quantity onto the plane tangential to the surface $\Sigma(t)$. 
Specifically, for an arbitrary quantity $\textbf{f}$ defined on $\Sigma(t)$, we denote its tangential projection as $\textbf{f}_{||}^0 = (\textbf{I}-\textbf{nn})\cdot \textbf{f}^0$. 
We also employ the subscript $_I$ to indicate any quantity inherently defined on the interface. 
Consequently, notice that the diffusive flux $\bm{\sigma}_{I||}^0$ and $\textbf{q}_{I||}^0$ appear as quantity projected on the surface tangential plane.
Indeed, it can be shown that only the tangential parts of the diffusive flux plays a role in the surface momentum balance equations, see \citet{slattery2007interfacial}.
We also introduced the notation $\Jump{\ldots}$, which is defined as $\Jump{\ldots} = \sum_{k=1}^2 [\ldots] \cdot \textbf{n}_k$.
Where $\textbf{n}_k$ is the outward normal vector associated with the domain $\Omega_k$ (see \ref{fig:Scheme}).
This term account for the discontinuity of the fluxes in each phases across the interfaces.
The local quantity appearing in are taken as the limit as the bulk quantity on the interface. 
A mathematical definition is given in \citet{bothe2022sharp}. 

The formulations given by \ref{eq:dt_rho_I},\ref{eq:dt_rhoIu_I}and \ref{eq:dt_rhoI} remain quite general and need some further simplifications. 
We assume that the momentum diffusive flux of surface is solely due to surface tension, therefore $\bm{\sigma}_I^0  = \gamma (\textbf{I} - \textbf{nn}) = \gamma \textbf{I}_{||}$ where $\gamma$ is the surface tension coefficient which will be assumed constant \citep[Chapter 2]{tryggvason2011direct}.  
Note that in a more general case, interfacial viscous stress could be included into $\bm{\sigma}_{I}^0$ \citep{brenner2013interfacial,slattery2007interfacial,nadim1996concise}, nevertheless it will not be addressed in this study. 
Additionally, we assume the surface density to be negligible thus $\rho_I = 0$ and since we considered no energy accumulation at the interface $\textbf{q}_I=0$. 
% Assuming no mass exchanges, i.e. the  $\textbf{u}_I^0 = \textbf{u}_k^0$ on $\Sigma(t)$ nor momentum  nor kinetic energy accumulation at the interface
The surface mass, momentum and total energy balance equations can be rewritten as, 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:dt_rho_I}
    \Jump{
        \rho_k (\textbf{u}_I - \textbf{u}_k)
        % \mathbf{T}_k
    }
    &=0 \\
    \Jump{\bm{\sigma}_k^0} 
    &=
    \gamma\kappa\textbf{n}
    % + \gradI\sigma 
    \label{eq:surface_tension}\\
    \label{eq:dt_rhoI_EI}
    \Jump{\textbf{u}_k^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_k^0 - \textbf{q}_k^0}
    &= 
     \gamma\kappa\textbf{n}\cdot \textbf{u}_{I}^0
    % \label{eq:dt_rhoIe_I}
    % \Jump{ \textbf{q}_k^0}eq:dt_rho_I
    % &= 
    %  0
\end{align}
respectively. 
Where $\kappa = - \div\textbf{n}$ is the interface curvature.
% In \ref{eq:surface_tension}, we can clearly identify two contributions : the first one related to the curvature, and the second one from the non-constant surface tension coefficient along the surface. 
% The latter contribution is responsible for the Marangonie effect.
% This terms 
\ref{eq:dt_rhoI_EI} is the jump equation for the total energy.
However, in the following it will be more practical to deal with an equation for the kinetic energy and internal energy. 
Then, we take the dot product of \ref{eq:surface_tension} with $\textbf{u}_I$ and subtract this new expression to \ref{eq:dt_rhoI_EI} which gives us the following jump condition, 
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:dt_rhoI_uI2}
    \Jump{\textbf{u}_k^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_k^0}
    &= 
     \gamma\kappa\textbf{n}\cdot \textbf{u}_{I}^0\\
    \label{eq:dt_rhoIe_I}
    \Jump{ \textbf{q}_k^0}
    &= 
     0
\end{align}
for the interface kinetic energy and the internal interface energy, respectively. 
The decomposition of the total energy jump condition into \ref{eq:dt_rhoI_uI2} and \ref{eq:dt_rhoIe_I} has been possible thanks to the consideration of no mass transfer in which case $\textbf{u}_I^0=\textbf{u}_k^0$ for $k =1,2$. 

\subsubsection{Generic equations}

The following the derivation will be similar for each conservation equation therefor it is useful to define a generic equation.
Let $f_k^0(\textbf{x},t)$ denote a volumetric quantity of arbitrary tensorial order defined in $\Omega_k(t)$.
Likewise, let $f_I^0(\textbf{x}_I,I)$ represent an arbitrary surface property defined on $\Sigma(t)$.
Using the strategy outlined in \citep{bothe2022sharp,morel2015mathematical,slattery2007interfacial}, we can derive the local conservation equations for both $f_k^0(\textbf{x},t)$ and $f_I^0(\textbf{x}_I,t)$.
They read,  
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:dt_f_k}
    \pddt f_k^0
    +\div \left(
        f_k^0\textbf{u}_k^0
        - \mathbf{\Phi}_k^0
        \right)
    &= 
    s_k^0
    & \text{ in } \Omega_k(t),&\\
    \pddt f_I^0 
    +\divI
    (
        f_I^0 \textbf{u}_I^0
        - \mathbf{\Phi}_{I||}^0 
    )
    &= 
    s_I^0
    - \Jump{
        f_k (\textbf{u}_I^0 - \textbf{u}_k^0)
        + \mathbf{\Phi}_k^0
     } 
    & \text{ on } \Sigma(t),&
    \label{eq:dt_f_I}
\end{align}
for respectively, $f_k^0$ and $f_I^0$.
The tensors $\mathbf{\Phi}_k^0$ and $\mathbf{\Phi}_{I||}^0$ represent the non-convective fluxes corresponding to $f_k^0$ and $f_I^0$. 
Notice that $\mathbf{\Phi}_{I||}^0$ also carries the $_{||}$ subscript which implies that only the tangential component of this tensor remain in the surface balance equation. 
Similarly, $s_k^0$ and $s_I^0$ represent the source terms for $f_k^0$ and $f_I^0$ respectively.
Lastly, $\textbf{u}_k^0$ corresponds to the velocity field defined in $\Omega_k(t)$, while $\textbf{u}_I^0$ corresponds to the velocity field defined on $\Sigma(t)$.

% \tb{introduce the jump as the lim at each interface, look in math book too}

It is important to note that \ref{eq:dt_f_k} and \ref{eq:dt_f_I} are solely defined within $\Omega_k(t)$ and $\Sigma(t)$ respectively.
Consequently, these equations are referred to as local conservation equations.
The objective of the next two sections is therefore to extend the domain of definition of these two equations to the whole space $\Omega$.

\subsection{Topological equations}

Using the distribution formalism, one may show that the transport equation of $\chi_k$ from \ref{eq:PIF} obey the following relations \citep{drew1983mathematical} 
\begin{align}
    \pddt \chi_k
    + \textbf{u}_I^0 \cdot \grad \chi_k
    &= 0,
    \label{eq:dt_chi_k}\\
% \end{align}
% \begin{align}
    \label{eq:grad_chi_k}
    \grad \chi_k
    &= - \delta_I \textbf{n}_k
\end{align}
where we introduced the interface indicator function defined in \ref{eq:PIF_I}. 
To describe the evolution of $\delta_I$ we take the gradient of \ref{eq:dt_chi_k} and the gradient of \ref{eq:grad_chi_k} which yields two equations of the interface indicator function \citep{morel2007surface},
% \begin{equation}
%     \pddt \delta_I
%     + \div \left[(\textbf{u}_I^0\cdot\textbf{n})\textbf{n} \delta_I\right]
%     = \delta_I (\textbf{u}_I^0\cdot\textbf{n})(\div\textbf{n}),
% \end{equation}
% where we did not specify the index of \textbf{n} since it appears twice in all terms of the equation. 
% As pointed out by \citet{morel2007surface}, it is more convenient to rewrite this equation under the following form,
\begin{align}
    \pddt \delta_I
    + \div (\delta_I \textbf{u}_I^0)
    &= \delta_I \divI \textbf{u}_I,
    \label{eq:dt_delta_I}\\
% \end{align}
% Lastly, we derive an expression for the gradient of $\delta_I$ by taking the gradient of \ref{eq:grad_chi_k}, resulting in,
% \begin{align}
    \grad\delta_I 
    &= \textbf{n} \cdot \grad (\textbf{n} \delta_I).
    \label{eq:grad_delta_I}
\end{align}
Then, \ref{eq:dt_chi_k}, \ref{eq:dt_delta_I}, \ref{eq:grad_delta_I} and \ref{eq:grad_chi_k} are commonly referred to as the topological equations for two-phase flows.


\subsection{Global conservation equations}

To extend the domain of definition of \ref{eq:dt_f_k} and \ref{eq:dt_f_I} to $\Omega$, we adopt the methodology introduced by \citet{drew1983mathematical} and \citet{kataoka1986local} for \ref{eq:dt_f_k}, and by \citet[Appendix 2]{marle1982macroscopic} for \ref{eq:dt_f_I}.

For any local quantities $f_k^0$ defined in $\Omega_k(t)$, we assign the field $\chi_k f_k^0$, which is defined over the entire domain $\Omega$. 
Likewise, for any surface property $f_I^0$ defined on $\Sigma(t)$, we assign the field $\delta_I f_I^0$, which is also defined all over $\Omega$. 
Then, multiplying \ref{eq:dt_f_k} and \ref{eq:dt_f_I} by respectively $\chi_k$ and $\delta_I$, and making use of the topological equations (\ref{eq:dt_chi_k}, \ref{eq:grad_chi_k}, \ref{eq:dt_delta_I} and \ref{eq:grad_delta_I}) gives, 
\begin{align}
    \pddt (\chi_k f_k^0)
    + \div (
        \chi_k f_k^0 \textbf{u}_k^0
        - \chi_k \mathbf{\Phi}_k^0 
        )
    &= 
    \chi_k s_k^0
    + \delta_I\left[
        f_k^0
        \left(
            \textbf{u}_I^0
            - \textbf{u}_k^0
        \right)
        + \mathbf{\Phi}_k^0
    \right]
    \cdot \textbf{n}_k ,
    \label{eq:dt_chi_k_f_k}\\
    \pddt (\delta_If_I^0)  
    + \div (
        \delta_I f_I^0 \textbf{u}_I^0
        - \delta_I \mathbf{\Phi}_{I||}^0 
        )
    &= 
    \delta_Is_I^0
    - \delta_I \Jump{
    f_k^0 (\textbf{u}_I^0 - \textbf{u}_k)
    + \mathbf{\Phi}_k^0
    },
    \label{eq:dt_delta_I_f_I}
\end{align}
which correspond to the conservation equations for $\chi_kf_k^0$ and $\delta_If_I^0$, respectively.
The last term on the right hands side of \ref{eq:dt_chi_k_f_k} represent the phase transfer of $f_k$ across the interfaces.
It will be shown that this term can be related to the drag force and energy fluxes between the continuous and dispersed phase. 
The set of equations formed by \ref{eq:dt_chi_k_f_k} for $k =1,2$ is commonly known as the \textit{two-fluid} formulation of multiphase flows, to which we add the \textit{jump condition} across the phase given by \ref{eq:dt_delta_I_f_I} \citep{morel2015mathematical,tryggvason2011direct,drew1983mathematical,kataoka1986local}. 

In this work, we prefer to think of those equations as a set of three equations formed by \ref{eq:dt_chi_k_f_k} for $k=1,2$ and \ref{eq:dt_delta_I_f_I}. 
Therefore, we define the \textit{bulk} property $\textbf{f}$ as $\textbf{f}^0 = \sum_k \chi_k \textbf{f}_k^0 + \delta_I \textbf{f}_I^0$ where $\textbf{f}^0$ represents any property of the flow of arbitrary tensorial order.
Then by summing \ref{eq:dt_chi_k_f_k} for $k=1,2$ and \ref{eq:dt_delta_I_f_I}, one obtain the \textit{single-fluid} formulation conservation equation, namely,
\begin{equation}
    \pddt f^0
    + \div (
        f^0 \textbf{u}^0
        -  \mathbf{\Phi}^0 
     )
    = s^0. 
    \label{eq:dt_f}
\end{equation}
It should be noted that in the literature we rather define the \textit{bulk} quantities as $f^0 = \sum_k \chi_k f_k^0$, while the interfacial component is treated as a source term in \ref{eq:dt_f} \citep{morel2015mathematical,tryggvason2011direct,drew1983mathematical}. 
Nevertheless, in our case, it is more convenient to consider \textit{bulk} quantities made of three phases.
