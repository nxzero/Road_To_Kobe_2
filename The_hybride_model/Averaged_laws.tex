Following  the strategy of \citet{drew1983mathematical,zhang1994averaged} and \citet{jackson1997locally},  we assign to the microscopic field $f(\textbf{y})$ defined over $\Omega$ the corresponding averaged field $\avg{f}(\textbf{x})$. 
Where $\avg{\ldots}$ is the average operator, $\textbf{y}$ is the spacial coordinate in the laboratory reference frame,
and $\textbf{x}$ macro scale coordinate in the averaged phase space.
The volume average of the microscopic field $f$ is then defined as \citep{nott2011suspension,jackson1997locally,marle1982macroscopic},
\begin{equation}
    \left<f\right>(\textbf{x}) = \int g(\textbf{x},\textbf{y}) f(\textbf{y})d \textbf{y},
    \label{eq:avg}
\end{equation}
where $g(\textbf{x},\textbf{y})$ is the smoothing or weighting function.
The first argument $\textbf{x}$, is location at which we take the average, and \textbf{y} is the variable of integration or the local coordinate vector.
The smoothing function $g(\textbf{x},\textbf{y})$ must follow two properties, the first one is normalization to unity
$\int g(\textbf{x},\textbf{y}) d\textbf{y} = 1$.
The second one is that $g$ vanish for all $\textbf{y}$ far form $\textbf{x}$, thus $\lim\limits_{|\textbf{r}| \to \infty} g(\textbf{x},\textbf{y}) = 0$ with $\textbf{r} = \textbf{x} - \textbf{y}$.
Also, the radius $l$, of the weighting function $g$, it is defined such that $\int_{|\textbf{r}|<l} g(\textbf{x},\textbf{y})d\textbf{y} = 1/2$.
Those characteristics ensure that the integral of \ref{eq:avg} is convergent and well normalized.
The volume average method is one among others such as the time average \citep{ishii2010thermo} and ensemble average \citep{zhang1994averaged}. 
However, all of these averaging technics remains equivalent \citep{jackson1997locally} as long as the separation of scale condition is respected, namely,
\begin{equation*}
    a \ll l \ll L,
\end{equation*}
where we recall that $a$ is the length scale of the particle, $l$ the length scale of the weighting function and $L$ the macroscopic length scale.
Similarly, we can use the statistical approach to carry out the average. 
% In order to derive the averaged equations we use the method of \citet{zhang2021ensemble} which extended the ensemble average definition of \citet{batchelor1972sedimentation}. 
% Let, $P(\mathscr{C},t)$ be the probability density function that describe the probability of finding the flow in the configuration $\mathscr{C}$ at time $t$, were $\mathscr{C} = (\lambda_1,\lambda_2,\lambda_3,\ldots)$ is a finite set of all the parameters describing the dispersed phase at time $t$. 
% Then, we define $d\mathscr{P} = P(\mathscr{C},t)d\mathscr{C}$ as the probable number of particles in the incremental region of the particles' phase space $d\mathscr{C}$ around $\mathscr{C}$ at time $t$. 
% It follows this definition, that the ensemble average of an arbitrary property $f$ defined over $\Omega$ yields,
% \begin{equation}
%     \avg{f}(\textbf{x},t)
%     =\int f(\textbf{x},\mathscr{C},t) d\mathscr{P}. 
%     \label{eq:ensemble_avg}
% \end{equation}  
Besides, it is interesting to mention some mathematical properties shared by all the averaging operators. 
For two arbitrary Eulerian fields $f$ and $h$ we have,
\begin{align}
    &\avg{f+h} = \avg{f}+\avg{h}, 
    &\avg{\avg{f}h} = \avg{f}\avg{h}, \nonumber \\
    &\avg{\pddt f} 
    = \pddt\avg{f}, 
    &\avg{\nablabh f}
    = \nablab \avg{f}. 
    \label{eq:avg_properties}
\end{align}
The two first relations are called the Reynolds' rules, the $3^{th}$ one is the Leibniz' 
rule and the last one, the Gauss' rule \citep{drew1983mathematical}.
It is important to understand both method lead to the same results and thus are rigorously equivalent. 


Additionally, for any phase quantity defined in $\Omega_1$ we introduce the definition, 
\begin{equation}
    \phi_1\oneavg{f}(\textbf{x},t) = \avg{\chi_1 f_1}
    \label{eq:1_avg}
\end{equation}
where, $\phi_1(\textbf{x},t) = \avg{\chi_1}$ is the probability of being in the phase $1$ at \textbf{x}, known as the volume fraction, and 
$\oneavg{f}$ is the average of the field $\chi_1 f_1$ knowing that $\textbf{x}\in \Omega_1$. 
Similarly, for the particle fields, we can introduce the particle phase average by,
\begin{equation}
     \pnavg{q_\alpha}(\textbf{x},t) = \avg{\delta_\alpha f_\alpha}
     \label{eq:p_avg}
\end{equation}
where, $n_p(\textbf{x},t) = \avg{\delta_\alpha}$ is the probable number of finding the center of mass of a particle inside the volume $d\textbf{x}$ around the position \textbf{x} and  at time $t$, known as the number density. 
And, $\pnnavg{q_\alpha}$ is the consitional average of $q_\alpha\delta_\alpha$ knowing a particle is present inside the volume $d\textbf{x}$ around the position \textbf{x} at time $t$. 


\subsubsection*{Continuous and particle averaged equations}
Applying \ref{eq:avg} on \ref{eq:dt_chi_k_f_k} and \ref{eq:dt_delta_I_f_I} and considering the properties from \ref{eq:avg_properties} yields the general form of the averaged equations of multiphase flows, namely,
\begin{align}
    \pddt \avg{\chi_k f_k}
    &= \nablabh \cdot \avg{\chi_k \mathbf{\Phi}_k - \chi_k f_k \textbf{u}_k}
    + \avg{\chi_k \textbf{S}_k}
    + \avg{\delta_I\left[
        \mathbf{\Phi}_k
        + f_k
        \left(
            \textbf{u}_I
            - \textbf{u}_k
        \right)
    \right]
    \cdot \textbf{n}_k} ,
    \label{eq:avg_dt_chi_f}\\
    \pddt \avg{\delta_If_I}
    &= 
    \nablabh \cdot \avg{\delta_I \mathbf{\Phi}_{I||} - \delta_I f_I \textbf{u}_I}
    +\avg{\delta_I\textbf{S}_I} 
    - \avg{\delta_I \Jump{
    f_k (\textbf{u}_I - \textbf{u}_k)
    + \mathbf{\Phi}_k
    } }.
    \label{eq:avg_dt_delta_f}
\end{align}
Together \ref{eq:avg_dt_delta_f}  and \ref{eq:avg_dt_delta_f} form the \textit{two-fluid} formulation of averaged multiphase flows problem. 
Besides, on can derive the so-called averaged \textbf{single-fluid} formulation by applying \ref{eq:avg} on \ref{eq:dt_f} which directly gives us, 
\begin{equation}
    \pddt \avg{f}
    = \nablab \cdot \avg{\mathbf{\Phi} - f \textbf{u}}
    + \avg{\textbf{S}}.
    \label{eq:avg_dt_f}
\end{equation}
It is interesting to notice that in Volume Of Fluid method we solve for the fields averaged on a cell volume, thus we actually discretize \ref{eq:avg_dt_f} and solve for the averaged quantities \citep{popinet2018numerical,tryggvason2011direct} instead of directly solving the local transport equations \ref{eq:dt_f}.

Correspondingly, we take the average of the particle fields equations by using \ref{eq:avg} on \ref{eq:dt_dq_alpha} and \ref{eq:dt_dq_I_alpha}, giving, 
\begin{multline}
    \pddt \pavg{ q_\alpha}
    + \nablabh\cdot \pavg{ q_\alpha \textbf{u}_\alpha}
    = \pavg{\int_{\Omega_\alpha} \textbf{S}_k d\Omega}\\
    + \pavg{\int_{\Sigma_\alpha} \left[\mathbf{\Phi}_k + f_k (\textbf{u}_I-\textbf{u}_k) \right] \cdot \textbf{n}_k d\Sigma},
    \label{eq:avg_dt_dq_alpha}
\end{multline}
\begin{multline}
    \pddt \pavg{ q_{I\alpha}}
    + \nablabh\cdot \pavg{ q_{I\alpha} \textbf{u}_\alpha}
    = \pavg{\int_{\Sigma_\alpha} 
    \textbf{S}_I
    d\Sigma}\\
    - \pavg{\int_{\Sigma_\alpha} \Jump{
        f_k (\textbf{u}_I - \textbf{u}_k)
        + \mathbf{\Phi}_k}
        d\Sigma}.
        \label{eq:avg_dt_dq_I_alpha}
\end{multline}
When considering a dispersed multiphase flows problem we use Euler-Euler method to solves the equations of the continuous and dispersed phase numerically. 
In those code we solve the equations for the cell averaged values, thus we should consider discretizing \ref{eq:avg_dt_dq_I_alpha} and \ref{eq:avg_dt_dq_alpha} while solving the dispersed phase equations.
