\subsection{Equivalence between particle-averaged and phase-averaged equations}
\label{sec:equivalence}
%To model the dispersed phase we can either use \ref{eq:avg_dt_chi_f} with $k=d$, or the particle-averaged equations: \ref{eq:avg_dt_dq_alpha_tot}, \ref{eq:avg_dt_dQ_alpha_tot} and possibly the higher moments equations in \ref{ap:Moments_equations}. 
%Consequently, it is fair to address the question of the compatibility and differences between both formalisms. 
To model the dispersed phase, we have two main approaches. 
We can either use Equation \ref{eq:avg_dt_chi_f} with $k=d$, or we can employ the particle-averaged equations \ref{eq:avg_dt_dq_alpha_tot}, \ref{eq:avg_dt_dQ_alpha_tot} and potentially the higher moments equations found in \ref{ap:Moments_equations}.
Consequently, it is important to address the compatibility between these two formalisms.
It has been demonstrated in various studies \citep{lhuillier1992ensemble,jackson1997locally,zhang1994averaged}, that phase-averaged quantities can be expressed as a Taylor series expansion of particle-averaged quantities. 
Indeed, the dispersed phase indicator function $\chi_d(\textbf{x},t)$ can be expressed as a sum of phase indicator function, $\chi_d(\textbf{x},t) = \sum_\alpha\chi_\alpha(\textbf{x},t)$ where $\chi_\alpha =1$ in the particle domain $\Omega_\alpha(t)$ and $0$ otherwise. 
Then, notice that any dispersed phase quantity can be written as, 
\JL{Il faut absolument aussi citer le papier de Daniel : fluid dynamics of particulate suspension selected topics - qui fait quelque chose de tres similaire.
Par ailleurs je n'aime pas bcp la relation ci apres. Ca me derange de faire apparaitre une integrale volumique avec un Dirac.
\begin{equation*}
    f^0_d \chi_d(\textbf{x},t)
    = \sum_\alpha f^0_d \chi_\alpha(\textbf{x},t) 
    = \sum_\alpha \int_{\mathbb{R}^3} f^0_d \chi_\alpha(\textbf{x}_\alpha+\textbf{r},t)\delta(\textbf{x}- \textbf{x}_\alpha - \textbf{r}) d\textbf{r} 
    \label{eq:taylor_f_d}
\end{equation*}}
Upon using the Taylor expansion of the Dirac delta function in the neighborhood of $\textbf{r}=0$ one obtain :  $\delta(\textbf{x}- \textbf{x}_\alpha - \textbf{r}) = \delta(\textbf{x}- \textbf{x}_\alpha) - \textbf{r}\cdot\grad \delta(\textbf{x} - \textbf{x}_\alpha) + \frac{\textbf{rr}}{2}:\grad\grad\delta(\textbf{x}- \textbf{x}_\alpha) - \ldots $.
Thus, the dispersed-phase field $f_d^0\chi_d$ can be re-written as, 
\JL{je comprends ce que tu fais, mais dans le papier originel de Daniel 1992, il fait une expansion de taylor sur $f$. ca parait plus naturelle, car c'est f qui est suppos√© varier peu le long de la particule}
\begin{equation*}
    f^0_d \chi_d(\textbf{x},t)
    = \sum_\alpha \left[
          \left(\delta_\alpha\intO{f^0_d}\right)
        - \div\left(\delta_\alpha\intO{\textbf{r} f^0_d}\right)
        + \frac{1}{2}\grad\grad :\left(\delta_\alpha\intO{\textbf{rr} f^0_d}\right)
        \ldots
    \right]
\end{equation*}
where we recognize the zeroth, first and second order moments of $f_d^0$. 
Applying similar considerations to the interface indicator function $\delta_\Gamma$, and averaging over all configurations, we obtain the general relations that link continuous-averaged and particle-averaged fields, namely, 
\begin{align}
    \avg{\chi_df_d^0} 
    &=  \pavg{\text q_\alpha}
        - \div  
        \pavg{\textbf{q}_\alpha^{(1)}}        
        + \frac{1}{2} \grad\grad : \pavg{\textbf{q}_{\alpha}^{(2)}}
        + \ldots  
        \nonumber\\
    \avg{\delta_\Gamma  f_\Gamma ^0} 
    &=  \pavg{\text q_{\Gamma \alpha}}        
        - \div \pavg{\textbf{q}_{\Gamma\alpha}^{(1)}}
        + \frac{1}{2} \grad\grad : \pavg{\textbf{q}_{\Gamma\alpha}^{(2)}}
        + \ldots  
    \label{eq:f_exp}
\end{align}
% It must be noted that \ref{eq:f_exp} is the bridge between the continuous phase average formalism and the particle formulation. 

\JL{pour l'instant j'ai eneleve la partie applicative (meme si elle me semble tres interessante). 
D'ailleurs pq le second terme du dvt pr les conservation de la masse est nul ? 
Ce serait bien de donner de petites lois d'echelles pr evaluer les ordres de grandeurs de chacun des termes.}
%Particularly we note that if $f_d^0 = \rho_d$ and $f_d^0 = \rho_d \textbf{u}_d^0$ we obtain, 
%\begin{align}
%    \label{eq:f_exp_exe1}
%    \phi_d \rho_d
%    = m_p n_p 
%    + \frac{1}{2}\grad^2 : (n_p\textbf{M}_p)+\ldots,\\
%    \phi_d \rho_d \textbf{u}_d
%    = m_p n_p \textbf{u}_p 
%    - \div (n_p\textbf{P}_p)+\ldots,
%    \label{eq:f_exp_exe}
%\end{align}
%respectively. 
%Meaning that $\phi_d\rho_d$ is related to the shape of the particles, represented by $\textbf{M}_p$ through \ref{eq:f_exp_exe1}.
%Additionally, considering \ref{eq:f_exp_exe}, it becomes apparent that the phase-averaged velocity $\textbf{u}_d$ encompasses the first moment of momentum $\textbf{P}_p$, which as discussed (in \ref{sec:Lagrangian}) accounts for the rotational, dilatational, and stretching motions of the particles. 
%The second terms on the right-hand side of \ref{eq:f_exp_exe1} and \ref{eq:f_exp_exe} become negligible for homogeneous mixture, i.e. if $n_p$, $\textbf{M}_p$ and $\textbf{P}_p$ are not function of \textbf{x}. 
%Conversely, these terms might become significant if $n_p$, $\textbf{M}_p$ or $\textbf{P}_p$ are space-dependent.
%For example, close to solid boundaries of a macroscopic flow strong gradients of $n_p$ are present at the particle length scale, since at the exact location of the boundaries we must respect $n_p = 0$. 
%In \cite{prosperetti1995finite} they study the importance of these terms, especially their remark that the approximation $\phi \approx n_p v_p$ may have significant consequence on the hyperbolicity of a two-phase flow system. 

In order to establish the equivalence between both formalism, we follow the strategy of \citep{lhuillier2000bilan,lhuillier2009rheology} by taking the Taylor expansion of each terms in \ref{eq:avg_dt_chi_f} with $k=d$ using the relation \ref{eq:f_exp}. 
Since we made use of the surface transport equations in the particles phase equations : \ref{eq:avg_dt_dq_alpha_tot} and \ref{eq:avg_dt_dQ_alpha_tot}, we also consider \ref{eq:avg_dt_delta_f} to prove equivalence. 
As the resulting expression can become quite cumbersome, we will adopt the following definition. 
Let $\mathcal{C}_d$ represent the phase-averaged equation of conservation (\ref{eq:avg_dt_chi_f} with $k=d$) and $\mathcal{C}_\Gamma $ the averaged surface transport equation, namely, 
\begin{align*}
    \mathcal{C}_d
    &=
    - \pddt \avg{\chi_df_d^0}
    - \div \avg{\chi_d \mathbf{\Phi}_d^0 - \chi_df_d^0 \textbf{u}_d^0}
    + \avg{\chi_d s_d^0}
    + \avg{\delta_\Gamma \left[
        \mathbf{\Phi}_d^0
        + f_d^0
        \left(
            \textbf{u}_\Gamma ^0
            - \textbf{u}_d^0
        \right)
    \right]
    \cdot \textbf{n}_d}.\\
    \mathcal{C}_\Gamma 
    &= 
    -\pddt \avg{\delta_\Gamma f_\Gamma ^0}
    -\div \avg{\delta_\Gamma  f_\Gamma ^0 \textbf{u}_\Gamma ^0-\delta_\Gamma  \mathbf{\Phi}_{I||}^0 }
    + \avg{\delta_\Gamma s_\Gamma ^0} 
    - \avg{\delta_\Gamma  \Jump{
    f_k^0 (\textbf{u}_\Gamma ^0 - \textbf{u}_k^0)
    + \mathbf{\Phi}_k^0
    } }. 
\end{align*}
It must be understood from \ref{eq:avg_dt_chi_f} and \ref{eq:avg_dt_delta_f} that $\mathcal{C}_d=0$ and $\mathcal{C}_\Gamma =0$.
By taking the Taylor expansion of each terms of $\mathcal{C}_d+\mathcal{C}_\Gamma $ we can show that,
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{C}_d 
    + \mathcal{C}_\Gamma  
    = \mathcal{M}^{(0)} - \div \mathcal{M}^{(1)} + \frac{1}{2} \grad\grad : \mathcal{M}^{(2)} \ldots = 0,
    \label{eq:scheme_equivalence}
\end{equation} 
where the expression $\mathcal{M}^{(0)}$ and $\mathcal{M}^{(1)}$ turn out to be, 
\begin{align*}
    &\mathcal{M}^{(0)}
    = 
    - \avg{\delta_\alpha \ddt {Q_\alpha}}
    % -\avg{\delta_\alpha\textbf{u}_\alpha q_\alpha^\text{tot}}
    + \pOavg{ s_d^0 }
    + \pSavg{ s_\Gamma ^0 }
    + \pSavg{ 
    \left[\mathbf{\Phi}_f^0 
    + f_f^0 (\textbf{u}_\Gamma ^0-\textbf{u}_f^0) \right] \cdot \textbf{n}_d },\\
    &\mathcal{M}^{(1)} =
    -  \avg{\delta_\alpha \ddt {\textbf{Q}_\alpha^{(1)}}}
    % - \avg{\delta_\alpha\textbf{u}_\alpha \textbf{Q}_\alpha^\text{tot}}
     + \pOavg{ \left(
        \textbf{r} s_d^0         
        + f_d^0  \textbf{w}_d^0 
        - \mathbf{\Phi}_d^0
    \right) }
    + \pSavg{ \left(
        \textbf{r}s_\Gamma ^0
        + f_\Gamma ^0 \textbf{w}_\Gamma ^0
        - \mathbf{\Phi}_{\Gamma||}^0
    \right) }\\
    &+ \pSavg{ \textbf{r} \left[
        \mathbf{\Phi}_f^0
        + f_f^0 (\textbf{u}_\Gamma ^0-\textbf{u}_f^0)
    \right]\cdot \textbf{n}_d  },
\end{align*}
respectively. 
In the presence of \ref{eq:scheme_equivalence}, we reach the major conclusion of this work. 
Indeed, we can observe that $\mathcal{M}_0$ and $\mathcal{M}_1$ represent the zeroth and first order moments equations, respectively. 
Additionally, it is shown in \ref{ap:Moments_equations} that the coefficient $\mathcal{M}_n$ in \ref{eq:scheme_equivalence} correspond to the $n^{th}$ order moment particle-averaged conservation equation. 
From \ref{eq:scheme_equivalence} we conclude that \ref{eq:dt_chi_k_f_k} for $k=d$ encompasses the particles moments equations through a Taylor expansion around the particle center of mass. 
Thus, it is evident that one can use an arbitrary order of particles moments equations to achieve an arbitrarily accurate description of the dispersed phase, regardless of the properties of the multiphase flow.
In \cite{lhuillier2000bilan} they reached a similar conclusion when comparing the phase-averaged area density and particle-averaged area density equations for spherical particles. 
In \ref{ap:Moments_equations} we provide the expression for each $\mathcal{M}_n$ as well as the complete derivation of \ref{eq:scheme_equivalence}. 

Another approach is to notice that $\mathcal{M}_n=0$ for all $n$ since \ref{eq:dt_Q_n} holds for all $n$. 
Thus, we can rewrite \ref{eq:scheme_equivalence} such that all moments equations vanish, except $\mathcal{M}_0$ (which is arbitrary), this gives, 
\begin{equation}
    \mathcal{C}_d 
    + \mathcal{C}_\Gamma 
    = \mathcal{M}^{(0)} = 0.
    \label{eq:proof2}
\end{equation}
This implies that equation \ref{eq:avg_dt_chi_f} with the surface transport equation \ref{eq:avg_dt_delta_f} is rigorously equivalent to \ref{eq:avg_dt_dq_alpha_tot}.
\citet[Appendix A]{zhang1997momentum} provided evidences that the particle-averaged momentum equation is as legitimate as the phase-averaged momentum equation, which is consistent with \ref{eq:proof2}. 
Additionally, \citet[Appendix A]{nott2011suspension} derived a similar expression than \ref{eq:proof2}, also in the case of the averaged momentum equation for suspension of solid spherical particles.
Thus, in light of \ref{eq:proof2}, we generalize the conclusion of these authors and demonstrated that this is also true for all conservation laws regardless of the dispersed phase nature.  
Considering the Lagrangian equations derived in \ref{sec:Lagrangian} this conclusion is not surprising at all since the phase-averaged and particle-averaged equations are all built on \ref{eq:dt_f_k} and \ref{eq:dt_f_I}.
However, if one does not consider a proper derivation as it is done in \ref{sec:Lagrangian} it might not be as obvious, even if \ref{eq:proof2} should remain true as demonstrated by \citet{zhang1997momentum,nott2011suspension}.
Nevertheless, it is important to note that the conclusion given by \ref{eq:proof2} is not entirely objective since following the same procedure we could show equally that $\mathcal{C}_d  = -\div\mathcal{M}^{(1)}=0$ and $\mathcal{C}_d  = \frac{1}{2}\grad\grad:\mathcal{M}^{(2)}=0$ and so on. 
Thus, it is more appropriate to examine the problem from the perspective of \ref{eq:scheme_equivalence}. 
Namely, the particle-averaged equations constitute a system of equations with one equation for each moment, while the phase-averaged equation contains all the particle-averaged equations within a single equation.
Therefore, the particle-averaged formalism encompasses more information since it provides one equation for each moment. 
Note that this gain in information has been possible through the consideration of the topology of the dispersed phase. 




\subsection{The system of conservation.}

As the purpose of this work is not only to prove the equivalence, but also to provide a general framework to work with dispersed two-phase flows, we now expose \textit{The hybrid model}.

Let us assume that we must conserve the quantity $f^0$ at the local scale on the bulk and at the interfaces, (here $f^0$ could be the mass, momentum, concentration of chemical species etc \ldots) . 
Then the equations to solve for to conserve these quantities on a macroscopic scale with a hybrid description is constituted from one equation describing the fluid phase and $n$ equations describing the dispersed phase.  
In all it generality the hybrid description of $f$ might be written,
\begin{align}
    \pddt (\phi_f f_f)
    +\div (\phi_f f_f \textbf{u}_f - \mathbf{\Phi}_f^\text{eff})
    &= 
    \phi_f s_f
    - \pSavg{\left[
        \mathbf{\Phi}_f^0
        + f_f^0
        \left(
            \textbf{u}_\Gamma^0
            - \textbf{u}_f^0
        \right)
    \right]
    \cdot \textbf{n}_d} ,

        % = \sum_{e=1}^{n} 
        % \pOavg{
        %     \prod^{n}_{\substack{ m=1 \\m \neq e}} r_{i_m} [f_d^0\textbf{w}_d^0  - \bm\Phi_d^0]_{i_e}
        % }\nonumber\\
        % + \pOavg{ \pri{1}{n} (\textbf{s}_d^0)_k }

        % }
        % + \pSavg{ \pri{1}{n} (\textbf{s}_\Gamma^0)_k }\nonumber\\
        % +\pSavg{ \pri{1}{n} ([\bm\Phi_f^0 + \textbf{f}_f^0 \left(\textbf{u}_\Gamma^0 - \textbf{u}_f^0\right)]\cdot \textbf{n}_d)_k }.

        + \pSavg{ s_\Gamma^0 }\nonumber\\
        &+ \pSavg{ \left[\mathbf{\Phi}_f^0 + f_f^0 (\textbf{u}_\Gamma^0-\textbf{u}_f^0) \right] \cdot \textbf{n}_d },
        \label{eq:avg_hybrid_q}
        \\
        \pddt (n_p\textbf{Q}_p^{(1)})
        + \div (n_p \textbf{Q}_p^{(1)} \textbf{u}_p + \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' (Q_\alpha^{(1)})'})
        &=\pOavg{ \left(
            \textbf{r} s_d^0         
            + f_d^0  \textbf{w}_d^0 
            - \mathbf{\Phi}_d^0
        \right) }\nonumber\\
        + \pSavg{ \left(
            \textbf{r}s_\Gamma^0
            + f_\Gamma^0 \textbf{w}_\Gamma^0
            - \mathbf{\Phi}_{I||}^0
        \right) }
        &+ \pSavg{ \textbf{r} \left[
            \mathbf{\Phi}_f^0
            + f_f^0 (\textbf{u}_\Gamma^0-\textbf{u}_f^0)
        \right]\cdot \textbf{n}_d  }.
        \label{eq:avg_hybrid_q_1}
        \\\nonumber
        \vdots
\end{align}
With the effective continuous phase non-convective flux term written as, 
\begin{align*}
    \mathbf{\Phi}_f^\text{eff}
    = \avg{\chi_f f_f' \textbf{u}_f'}
    - \phi_f \bm\Phi_f
    - \pSavg{\textbf{r}\left[
        \mathbf{\Phi}_f^0
        + f_f^0
        \left(
            \textbf{u}_\Gamma^0
            - \textbf{u}_f^0
        \right)
    \right]
    \cdot \textbf{n}_d}
    + \div[\ldots]
\end{align*}
The only modification compared to what is already presented is that we expanded the exchange term of the continuous phase equations \eqref{eq:avg_hybrid_dt_chi_f}. 
Notice the terms $\div[\ldots]$ in the expression for  $\mathbf{\Phi}_f^\text{eff}$ indicates the presence of the higher moments of interphase exchange that appear due to the Taylor expansion of the interface term $\avg{\delta_\Gamma \left[
    \mathbf{\Phi}_f^0
    + f_f^0
    \left(
        \textbf{u}_\Gamma ^0
        - \textbf{u}_f^0
    \right)
\right]
\cdot \textbf{n}_d}$. 
Likewise, the three verticals dots below \ref{eq:avg_hybrid_q_1} indicates that one might eventually add an arbitrary number of dispersed phase equations of any $n^{th}$ order moment $\textbf{Q}_p^{(n)}$, which are given by \ref{eq:dt_Q_n}. 
Under this form we can notice that the exchange term on the right-hand side of \ref{eq:avg_hybrid_dt_chi_f} is exactly the one appearing on the right-hand side of \ref{eq:avg_hybrid_q}. 
Additionally, in the effective flux $\mathbf{\Phi}_f^\text{eff}$ one see appear the exchange term of \ref{eq:avg_hybrid_q_1} and so on for the higher moments equations. 
Consequently, the zeroth order exchange term makes the transfer between $Q_\alpha^{(0)}$ and plays the role of a source term for $f_f$, while the first and higher order exchange terms act as a source for the $\textbf{Q}_p^{(n)}$, and play the role of an effective non-convective fluxes for $f_f$. 


The system is composed of $n+1$ equations for $n+1$ unknown that are : $f_f$, $\textbf{Q}_p^{(1)}$\ldots$\textbf{Q}_p^{(n)}$. 
Notice that one might include $\phi_f$ and $n_p$ as unknowns by adding an equation for these terms by setting $f_f=1$ and $Q_\alpha^{(n)} =1$ in \ref{eq:avg_hybrid_dt_chi_f} and \ref{eq:avg_hybrid_q}.
The closure problem consists in finding an explicit expression for all the term in these equations in terms of the unknowns of the problem, which are, 
$f_f$, $Q_\alpha$, $Q_\alpha^{(1)}$ \ldots $Q_\alpha^{(n)}$.  
Once that is done the equations can be solved for $f_f$,  $Q_\alpha$, $\textbf{Q}_p^{(1)}$\ldots$\textbf{Q}_p^{(n)}$. 
The question that we would like to address now is : in which cases the higher moments $\textbf{Q}_p^{(n)}$ is needed in this system of equations ?
There is two reason for which the moment $\textbf{Q}_p^{(n)}$ could be needed, that is : 
(1) because $\textbf{Q}_p^{(n)}$ could be an information that we seek to obtain as it is.
For instance think of the orientation of fibers in a flow, which correspond to the second moment of the distribution of mass.  
This information is the objective of a simulation as one seek to understand how the orientation of fiber end up in the flow for industrial purpose. 
(2) because $\textbf{Q}_p^{(n)}$ is essential to compute one of the closure in the above equations. 
Again, the particle orientation, even if the user isn't interested in this information for industrial purposes, it might be relevant, or even essential to model accurately the closure terms. 
Another example might be the particle angular velocity, which corresponds to the first order moment of momentum. 
This information is often not the final objective of the study, nevertheless it is essential to well model the closure terms of \textit{The hybrid model}. 
Therefore, the answer to the question : in which cases the higher moments $\textbf{Q}_p^{(n)}$ is needed in this system of equations ?
We can conclude that it is needed uniquely if the closure terms are highly dependent on the higher moments, or if the information given by $\textbf{Q}_p^{(n)}$ is the objective of the study at hand. 

The clear and general exposition of system of equations exposed here enables us to better understand the role of the dispersed phase non-convective flux term $\bm\Phi_d$ and $\bm\Phi_\Gamma$, in the particle phase conservation equation. 
Indeed, as evidenced by \ref{eq:avg_hybrid_q}, $\bm{\Phi}_d$ and $\bm{\Phi}_\Gamma$ do not play any role in the particle-phase averaged conservation, i.e. the equation of $n_pQ_p$. 
However, as shown in \ref{eq:avg_dt_chi_f} (for $k = d$) and \ref{eq:avg_dt_delta_f}, the phase averaged quantities $f_d$ and $f_\Gamma$, are subject to the particle surface and internal non-convective fluxes, since $\bm{\Phi}_d$ and $\bm{\Phi}_\Gamma$ are present in these equations.
These facts may seem in contradiction, however, remark that $\bm{\Phi}_d^0$ and $\bm{\Phi}_\Gamma^0$ play the role of source term in the conservation equation of the higher moments : $\textbf{Q}^{(2)}_p$ \ldots $\textbf{Q}^{(n)}_p$, which are related to $f_d$ and $f_\Gamma$ through \ref{eq:f_exp}.
In brief, the non-convective fluxes $\bm{\Phi}_d$ and $\bm{\Phi}_\Gamma$  are not explicitly related to $Q_p$, and that regardless of the particles nature and volume fraction. 
Consequently, the influence of $\bm{\Phi}_d$ and $\bm{\Phi}_\Gamma$ on $Q_p$ is made solely through the dependence of closure term present in \ref{eq:avg_hybrid_q} with the higher moments : $\textbf{Q}^{(1)}_p$ \ldots $\textbf{Q}^{(n)}_p$, which are them self explicitly dependent on $\bm{\Phi}_d$ and $\bm{\Phi}_\Gamma$ through \ref{eq:avg_hybrid_q_1}. 
Consequently, it must be understood that the kinetic-like equations (\ref{eq:avg_dt_dq_alpha_tot}) is formally exact and apply for any type of particle and particle volume fraction, as long as the closure terms are well modeled and that the Taylor expansion used in these expressions reaches a convergence on the scale of the particles.
