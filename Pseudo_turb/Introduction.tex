\begin{itemize}
    \item In the perspective of macroscopic modeling we have to close some terms 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item oil water processes
        \item vapour water process mu r = 6 
    \end{itemize}
    \item In the literature there is absolutely nothing for emulsion 
    \item Thus we study $Bo = 1$ $mu_r = 0.1$ and $\rho_r = 1.11$. 
    \item Within the framework of hybrid model averaged equations in a mono-disperse case 
    \item Present theritical : 
     \begin{itemize}
        \item Momentum averaged equation for fluid particle two-fluid formulation. 
        \item Closure terms. (Merabahdi)
    \end{itemize}
