In this study we developed a new kind of algorithm which prevent numerical coalescence between VOF tracer within a simulation of buoyant emulsion. 
This enabled us to perform statistically steady simulation of buoyant droplets with various \textit{Galileo} number, volume fraction and viscosity ratios. 

By the mean of the nearest neighboring statistics we described the flow structure around an averaged situation. 
We analyze the velocity field in the vicinity of the particles together with the relative position of the particles in an average manner. 

These results enabled us to make physical points on the closure terms results presented in the followed section. 
Finally, after a clear explanation of the force and Reynolds stress we propose semi-empirical formula to close the averaged equation in those regimes. 

Perspective : a lots of work is needed to well close the RANS especially one must studies the particles interactions.
