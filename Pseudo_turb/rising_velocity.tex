\section{Average drag force}

In this section, we start by reviewing the various existing models for the averaged drag force acting on fluid inclusions in the Stokes regime. Subsequently, we consider the intermediate Reynolds number regime, the primary focus of our current investigation, proposing a drag model that reasonably fits the numerical results. 
As demonstrated in the previous section, the droplet maintains an approximate spherical shape within the range of parameters studied here. Although slight deviations from sphericity are noted for $Bo=0.5$ and in configurations with the highest inertia, the maximum deviation from the spherical shape remains moderate less than $4$ \%. 
Hence, in this section we assume that fluid inclusions are spherical.



\subsection{Stokes flow regime}

%From an experimental point of view it appears to be very challenging at most to measure the force acting on rising fluid particles in moderately dense regimes and relate it to the kinematic properties of the fluid and the particles. However, one may easily measure the mean settling or rising velocity of a suspension by measuring the velocity of its front \citep{guazzelli2011}. The mean velocity of fluid particles settling or rising in a finite vessel is known to be hindered, \textit{i.e.} to decrease with respect to the velocity of the isolated particle. Indeed the presence of a fixed bottom in a container leads to a zero velocity for the entire suspension (fluid + solid). Hence as the drops move upward, the fluid must move downward to compensate for the motion of the inclusions. This results in a decrease in the rising speed of the drops. It is usual to write this hindered velocity as  

From an experimental standpoint, quantifying the force exerted on ascending fluid particles in moderately dense conditions and establishing its correlation with the kinematic properties of both the fluid and the particles poses considerable challenges. Nonetheless, a feasible alternative involves measuring the mean settling or rising velocity of a suspension by measuring the velocity of its front \citep{guazzelli2011}. In a confined vessel, the mean velocity of fluid particles undergoing settling or rising is known to be hindered; that is, it decreases in comparison to the velocity of an isolated particle. The presence of a fixed container bottom induces a zero velocity for the entire suspension (comprising both continuous and dispersed phases). Consequently, as the droplets ascend, the fluid must move downward to counterbalance the motion of the inclusions, resulting in a reduction of the rising speed of the droplets \citep{guazzelli2011}. This hindered velocity is usually expressed as

%This decrease arises due to the presence of a stationary bottom in the container, causing the entire suspension (comprising both continuous and dispersed phases) to have a zero velocity \citep{guazzelli2011}. Consequently, as the droplets ascend, there is a compensatory downward movement of the fluid to counterbalance the motion of the inclusions, resulting in a reduction in the ascent speed of the droplets. This hindered velocity is conventionally expressed as...

%From an experimental standpoint, quantifying the force acting on ascending fluid particles in moderately dense conditions and establishing its correlation with the kinematic characteristics of both the fluid and particles poses considerable challenges. However, a more accessible metric involves determining the mean settling or rising velocity of a suspension by observing the velocity of its leading edge \citep{guazzelli2011}. In a confined vessel, the mean velocity of fluid particles settling or rising is recognized to be impeded, signifying a decrease relative to the velocity of an isolated particle. The presence of a fixed container bottom induces a zero velocity for the entire suspension (comprising both fluid and solid components). Consequently, as the droplets ascend, the fluid must descend to counterbalance the motion of the inclusions, resulting in a reduction of the rising speed of the droplets. This hindered velocity is conventionally expressed as


\begin{equation}
\frac{u_p}{U_0} = f(\phi)
\end{equation}
where $U_0$ is the rising speed of an isolated fluid inclusion and $f$ is a decreasing function of $\phi$. For fluid inclusion, in the Stokes regime ($Re=0$) the drag force is given by the Hadamard-Ribczynski formula $ F = -3\pi \mu d u_d (2/3+\lambda)/(1+\lambda)$. %drag coeficient is given by the Hadamard-Ribczynski formula 
Balancing this force with the buoyancy force one obtained the settling velocity of  spherical droplet in the Stokes regime

%\begin{equation}
%C_D = \frac{8}{Re} \left( \frac{2+3\lambda}{1+\lambda} \right)
%\end{equation}


\begin{equation}
    U_0
    = (\rho_f - \rho_d)\frac{g d^2}{18\mu_f}\left(\frac{1+\lambda}{2/3 + \lambda}\right),
    \label{eq:u_o}
\end{equation}
Hence a bubble rises 3/2 faster than a very viscous drop (or a solid sphere) of the same radius and density, the liquid properties being the same in each case.

The functional form of $f$ is much more complicated to obtain since it depends on both the microstructure and on the viscosity ratios. Specifically, for a dilute structure array consisting of a periodic arrangement of spherical inclusions, $f(\phi) =(1 - (2/3+\lambda)/(1+\lambda))a\phi^{1/3})$ where $a$ is a constant with a weak dependence on the specific form of the array \citep{sangani1987}. The decrease slope in velocity depends on $\lambda$. Indeed, the coefficient multiplying $\phi^{1/3}$ for a bubble ($\lambda=0$) is 2/3 of that for a solid particle ($\lambda \to \infty$). This is to be expected since this estimation is derived from the method of reflection and the aforementioned observation regarding the relative velocities of bubbles and solid particles. In contrast for random free array the function $f$ can be expressed as  $f(\phi) = (1-b(\lambda)\phi)$ where $b$ is a function approaching the value $6.5$ for large $\lambda$ and $4.5$ for small $\lambda$ \citep{wacholder1973,haber1981}. Once again, the rate of decrease is lower for bubbles compared to solid particles. We may also observe that the decrease of velocity as function of $\phi$ is much more pronounced for a structured array of inclusions compared to a random array. Hence the decrease of speed depends on the assumption made regarding the microstructure of the suspension \citep{davis1985}. In particular, rising bubbles at moderate Reynolds numbers show horizontal alignment of bubble pairs \citep{bunner2002dynamics,yin2006} which may suggest the use of a law designed for ordered microstucture. 
Interestingy, \citet{loisy2017} observed a decrease of the suspension velocity in $\phi^{1/3}$ in similar regime of Reynolds number. 

%The determination of the functional form of fff presents a heightened level of complexity due to its dependence on both microstructural features and viscosity ratios. Specifically, for a dilute structure array consisting of a periodic arrangement of spherical inclusions, f(ϕ)f(\phi)f(ϕ) is defined as (1−(2/3+λ)/(1+λ))aϕ1/3)(1 - (2/3+\lambda)/(1+\lambda))a\phi^{1/3})(1−(2/3+λ)/(1+λ))aϕ1/3), where aaa represents a constant with a weak dependence on the specific form of the array, as detailed by Sangani et al. (1987) \citep{sangani1987}. It is noteworthy that the diminution of velocity is contingent upon the parameter λ\lambdaλ, with the coefficient multiplying ϕ1/3\phi^{1/3}ϕ1/3 for a bubble being 2/32/32/3 times that for a solid particle. This alignment is anticipated, given that this estimation is derived from reflection methods and the aforementioned observation regarding the relative velocities of bubbles and solid particles.

%Conversely, for a random free array, the function fff can be expressed as f(ϕ)=(1−b(λ)ϕ)f(\phi) = (1-b(\lambda)\phi)f(ϕ)=(1−b(λ)ϕ), where bbb is a function converging towards 6.56.56.5 for large λ\lambdaλ and 4.54.54.5 for small λ\lambdaλ \citep{wacholder1973,haber1981}. Once again, it is evident that the rate of decrease is more gradual for bubbles compared to solid particles. Additionally, the reduction in velocity as a function of ϕ\phiϕ is more pronounced for a structured array of inclusions compared to a random array. Consequently, the deceleration of speed is contingent upon the assumptions made regarding the microstructure of the suspension \citep{davis1985}. Specifically, the ascent of bubbles at moderate Reynolds numbers exhibits the horizontal alignment of bubble pairs \citep{bunner,Yin}, implying a ϕ1/3\phi^{1/3}ϕ1/3-dependent velocity reduction, as recently observed by Loisy.

% while for a random free array (see for instance Saffman for a discussion). The question of the microstructure in a suspension of settling particle is still open (citer Davis ...)



The results presented above are limited to very dilute configurations ($\phi \lesssim 5 \%$). However, in practical applications and especially in liquid-liquid extraction the volumic fraction of the dispersed phase can be as high as $20\%$. To adress moderately dense regimes, the current engineering approach involves resorting to empirical correlations such as the one developed by Richardson and Zaki  \citep{richardson1954}
%The current engineering practice, to obtain results in moderately dense regimes is to rely on empirical correlation such as the one developed by Richardson and Zaki  
\begin{equation}
f(\phi) = (1-\phi)^n
\label{eq:Richardson} 
\end{equation}
For solid spherical particles \citet{brzinski2018} have shown using data from 15 different studies drawn from the literature that $n$ is well approximated by $n\approx 4.5$. This approximation holds from very dilute regimes to dense regimes. As demonstrated in dilute flow there is a priori reason for this coefficient to be applicable to arbitrary viscosity ratios. \citet{ishii1979drag} by compiling various experiments found in the literature proposed values of $n\approx 3$ for bubbles and $n \approx 4$ for droplets. Hence, as in dilute flows the hindrance of the rising velocity is more pronounced for very viscous drops than low viscosity ones. To address this effect, we suggest the following correlation%To take into account this effect we propose the following correlation 

%As in diltute flows, an increase in the particle voulme fraction will make hinder
%there is a priori no reason for this coefficient to be valid for arbitrary viscosity ratio. 

%In this work we propose the following coefficient %In the most dilute configuration Wacholder oberseved a decrease of .... 

\begin{equation}
n(\lambda) = \frac{3}{2}\left(\frac{2+3\lambda}{1+\lambda}\right)
\label{eq:n}
\end{equation} 
which matches well the expressions proposed by \citet{brzinski2018} and \citet{ishii1979drag} in the limit of high and low viscosity ratios, respectively. There exist very few numerical results to validate this prediction. \citet{mo1994} have considered the fall of 16 drops within a tri-periodic box, revealing a coefficient $n$ slightly larger than in Equation \ref{eq:n} (details omitted here). The exact cause of this discrepancy remains uncertain and could stem from the slow decrease of the velocity perturbation in the Stokes flow regime. Indeed, special treatment are essential in this regime to ensure that the numerical results are independent from the number of inclusions \citet{mo1994}.

Our focus has been exclusively on the upward velocity of a droplet suspension. Can this information be related with the mean drag force experienced by the droplets? In the Stokes regime, the answer is affirmative. This is emphasized in the book of \citep{jackson2000}, and we draw a similar line of reasoning for ascending droplets. By eliminating the pressure gradient in the equations \ref{eq:dt_uf_steady} and \ref{eq:dt_up_steady}, we obtain the force acting on the droplets as
\begin{equation}
n_pf_p = \phi(1-\phi)(\rho_d -\rho _c)g
\label{eq:bdf}
\end{equation}
where $n_pf_p$ is the vertical component of $n\textbf{f}_p$. 
Due to the linearity of the Stokes equation the vertical component of the force per unit of volume may be expressed as, 
\begin{equation}
    n_pf_p = A (u_f -u_p)
    \label{eq:stokes}
\end{equation}
where $u_f$ and $u_p$ are the vertical component of $\textbf{u}_f$ and $\textbf{u}_p$ and $A$ is a function to be determined. 
Inserting this estimate in equation \ref{eq:bdf} we obtain 
\begin{equation}
A = \frac{\phi}{(1-\phi)^{n(\lambda)-2}} \frac{(\rho_f -\rho_d)g}{U_0} 
\end{equation}
where we use the condition that the total velocity within the suspension is zero, expressed as $u_f \phi_f + u_p \phi_d =0$ and equation \ref{eq:Richardson}. The expression for the average force per unit of volume reads %Making use of 


%Then assuming that the mean velocity of the suspension is zero (as obtained from mass conservation for a fixed container) we get

\begin{equation}
n_pf_p = \frac{24}{Re}\left(\frac{2/3+\lambda}{1+\lambda}\right)\frac{3}{4}\frac{\rho |u_f-u_p|(u_f-u_p)}{d}\frac{\phi}{(1-\phi)^{n-2}}
\end{equation}
where $Re = \rho_f |u_f-u_p| D/\mu$ is the Reynolds number based on the relative velocity. 
From the former expression one may easily write the mean force on the particles as,
\begin{equation}
f_p (Re,\lambda,\phi) = C_D^0(Re,\lambda)h(\lambda,\phi)\frac{1}{8}\rho \pi d^2 |u_f-u_p|(u_f-u_p)
\label{eq:FCD}
\end{equation}
where $C_D^0(Re,\lambda)=\frac{24}{Re}\left(\frac{2/3+\lambda}{1+\lambda}\right)$ is the modified drag coefficient on an isolated particle and,
\begin{equation}
    h(\phi,\lambda) =\frac{1}{(1-\phi)^{n-2}},
    \label{eq:h_stokes}
\end{equation} 
is the dependence with the volume fraction. 
This formulation is particularly interesting as it separates the effect of the Reynolds number from that of the void fraction in the total drag coefficient defined as,
\begin{equation}
    C_D(Re,\lambda,\phi) = C_D^0(Re,\lambda)h(\lambda,\phi).
    \label{eq:C_d_final}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Intermediate number Reynolds regime}


% Within the Reynolds number range investigated in this study ($1 \lesssim Re \lesssim 100$), it is not possible to predefine the functional form of the drag force on the Reynolds number. This is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:Re_Ga}. The figure reveals that the Reynolds number, based on the relative velocity, falls within the bounds of viscous scaling $Ga^1$ and inertial scaling $Ga^2$. It is noteworthy that increasing the volume fraction does not significantly modify the Reynolds number slope but simply shifts the points to higher $Ga$. 
% Hence as in the previous subsection one may expect that separating the influence of the void fraction from the influence of the Reynolds number may be appropriate. This is a common approach, as seen in the widely applied Wen and Yu correlation \citep{wen1966}, employed for calculating forces in fluidized beds and sedimenting fluidized particles. Hence we assume that the mean force can be expressed as equation \ref{eq:FCD}.


Unfortunately in contrast to the Stokes regime there is no theoretical formula for the drag force on an isolated droplet for arbitrary Reynolds number. One may use potential flow theory (except in an infinitely thin boundary layer developing on the bubble surface) to predict the drag force on an isolated droplet in the limit  $Re\gg 1$ \citep{harper1968}, but numerical computations have shown that the theory is only accurate for $Re\geq 200$ \citep{dandy1989}.
Hence in practice one have to rely on empirical relationship to predict the drag force on the drop. \citet{rivkind1970} proposed to write a drag force as a combination of the drag force on a solid spherical particle
(the limit ($\lambda \rightarrow \infty$) and the drag force on a spherical bubble ($\lambda \rightarrow 0$)

\begin{equation}
C_D^0(Re,\lambda) = \frac{C_{Ds}^0(Re)+\lambda C_{Db}^0(Re)}{1+\lambda}
\label{eq:CD0}
\end{equation}
where $C_{Ds}^0$ is the drag force on an isolated solid sphere and $C_{Db}^0$ the drag force on a shear-free bubble. Formula \ref{eq:CD0} constitutes a generalization of the Hadamard-Ribczynski formula in the intermediate Reynolds number regime. As suggested by \citet{magnaudet1997forces} we make use of the following correlation for the drag force on a solid particle and a bubble
\begin{align}
    \label{eq:shiller_neuman}
C_{Ds} ^0 &= \frac{24}{Re}(1+0.15Re^{0.687}) \\
%\end{equation}
%\begin{equation}
C_{Db} ^0 &= \frac{16}{Re}\left(1+\left[\frac{8}{Re}+\frac{1}{2}\left(1+3.315Re^{-1/2}\right)\right]^{-1}\right)
\label{eq:mei}
\end{align}
which where originally proposed by \citet{schiller1933} and \citet{mei1994} respectively. Formula \ref{eq:CD0} agrees with numerical results with an error of $5-7\%$ \citep{rivkind1970}.%Balancing the drag force obtained using the previous formula with the buoyancy force one obtained the settling velocity



The functional expression of $f(\phi)$ in \ref{eq:Richardson} also depends on the Reynolds number. 
According to \citet{richardson1997sedimentation}, these corrections for solid spherical particles at finite Reynolds numbers read, 
\begin{equation}
    n = \left\{
        \begin{tabular}{lll}
            &$n_0 =4.65$ & for $Re<0.2$\\ 
            &$n_1 = 4.35 Re^{-0.03}$ & for $0.2<Re<1$\\ 
            &$n_2 = 4.45 Re^{-0.1}$ & for $1<Re<500$\\ 
            &$n_3 = 2.39$ & for $500<Re$\\ 
        \end{tabular}
    \right.
\end{equation}
Latter \citet{kramer2019improvement} proposed an improvement to these factor and show that, 
\begin{equation}
    n = \frac{4.8 + 2.4 \cdot 0.048 Re^{0.75}}{1+0.048 Re^{0.75}},
    \label{eq:n_solid}
\end{equation} 
for any values of $Re$. 
\ref{eq:n_solid} is representing the weighted average between the low Reynolds number limit of  $n$ and its limit at $Re \to \infty$.  
While the value of $\lim_{Re\to\infty} n$ is unknown for droplets, we know that $n(Re = 0)$ is given by \ref{eq:Richardson}. 
Thus, we assume that \ref{eq:Richardson} provides the values of $n$ in the Stokes regime, and that the high Reynolds number limit of $n$ remains unchanged, leading us to use the following relation, 
\begin{equation}
    n = \frac{9 \frac{2+3\lambda}{\lambda+1} + 2.4 \cdot 0.048 Re^{0.75}}{1+0.048 Re^{0.75}}. 
    \label{eq:final_n}
\end{equation} 


\ref{eq:stokes} is only valid in stokes regime. 
In the Newtonian regime \ref{eq:stokes} transform to \citep{jackson2000}, 
\begin{equation}
    n_p f_p = A (u_p - u_f)^2. 
    \label{eq:inertial_relation}
\end{equation}
We recall that the bulk velocity $u= \phi_f u_f + \phi u_p = 0$, thus we may write, $(u_p - u_f)^2 = (1-\phi)^{-2} u_p^2$. 
Using \ref{eq:inertial_relation}, \ref{eq:Richardson} and \ref{eq:bdf} we obtain, 
\begin{equation*}
    A = \phi (1- \phi)^{3-2n}\frac{\Delta \rho g}{U_0^2},
\end{equation*}
which yields the following formula for the drag force density, 
\begin{equation}
     f_p =\frac{ \pi d^3}{6}  (1- \phi)^{3-2n}\frac{\Delta \rho g}{U_0^2} (u_p - u_f)^2. 
\end{equation}
Since the velocity of an isolated particle $U_0$ is by definition independent of $\phi$, we deduce that the drag force dependence on the volume fraction is given by the function, 
\begin{equation}
    h(\phi,\lambda)
    = 
    (1-\phi)^{3- 2n},
    \label{eq:h_new}
\end{equation}
in the Newtonian regime. 
Since in the low \textit{Reynolds} number regime ($Re\ll 1$), $h$ is given by \ref{eq:h_stokes} and in the Newtonian regime ($Re \gg 1$) $h$  follows \ref{eq:h_new}, we propose the following generalized relation,
\begin{equation}
    h(Re,\phi,\lambda)
    = \frac{(1-\phi)^{2-n}+ Re (1-\phi)^{3-2n}}{1+Re}
    \label{eq:geenralizedh}
\end{equation}
where $n$ is given by \ref{eq:final_n}. 
Consequently, the generalized drag coefficient can be expressed as:
\begin{equation}
    C_D(Re,\phi,\lambda)
    = 
    C_D^0(Re,\lambda)
    h(Re,\phi,\lambda)
    \label{eq:C_d_finalRe}
\end{equation}
where $h(Re,\phi,\lambda)$ is given by \ref{eq:geenralizedh} and $C_D^0(Re,\lambda)$ by \ref{eq:CD0}. 


To summarize, \ref{eq:C_d_final}, tends to the well-known relations \ref{eq:shiller_neuman} and \ref{eq:mei} in the dilute limit and for extreme values of $\lambda$.
Additionally, \ref{eq:CD0} has also been validated in previous studies. 
The dependence on $\phi$ is given by \ref{eq:geenralizedh} which has been validated only for solid particles, while for bubbles \ref{eq:geenralizedh} it is only validated in the Stokes flow regime. 
In conclusion, we have proposed a generalized drag force coefficient based on existing empirical and theoretical formulas that are known to be valid across different regimes. 
The only assumption in this development is the formulation given by \ref{eq:final_n} for high $Re$ and arbitrary values of $\lambda$. 
Therefore, it remains necessary to confirm that this assumption yields sufficiently accurate results for intermediate values of $\lambda$ at finite \textit{Reynolds} numbers. 


\section{Comparison with the numerical results}

In \ref{fig:cp} we display the values of $C_d$ obtained from the DNS using \ref{eq:C_d_adim}, against the theoretical predictions from \ref{eq:C_d_finalRe}. 
For $\lambda = 10$, corresponding to viscous droplets, the theoretical predictions perform very well across all Reynolds numbers and for $\phi \le 0.1$. 
However, for $\phi = 0.2$ and $Re \approx 50$ slight discrepancies can be observed between the DNS results and \eqref{eq:C_d_finalRe}. 
Similarly, for $\lambda = 1$, the same observations apply. 
The source of these discrepancies is difficult to identify, but it is possible that the arbitrary nature of \ref{eq:geenralizedh} leads to a reduced accuracy in the transitional regime.
Nevertheless, as shown in the sub-panels, the error remains within $20\%$, which is still acceptable.  

However, for $\lambda = 0.1$ the results are less satisfactory. 
In the dilute regime ($\phi = 0.01$) \ref{eq:CD0} does not accurately predict the drag coefficient. 
This discrepancy might come from two factors: either \ref{eq:mei} fails to capture the drag force for isolated bubbles with a density ratio close to 1, or the effect of the volume fraction is already significant at these \textit{Reynolds} numbers and is not properly accounted for by \ref{eq:geenralizedh} or \ref{eq:final_n}. 
Given that \ref{eq:mei} has been extensively validated in the literature, we conclude that the second assumption is likely responsible for the inaccuracy. 
For $Re < 50$ however,  \ref{eq:C_d_finalRe} perform very well.

\end{figure}

To ensure consistency, we now compare the \textit{Reynolds} numbers computed from our DNS with the theoretical predictions of \ref{eq:C_d_adim} using \ref{eq:C_d_finalRe}. 
Both results are divided by $Re_\text{stokes} = \frac{8}{Re} \frac{3\lambda +2}{\lambda+1}$ which represents the sedimentation \textit{Reynolds} number of an isolated particle in Stokes flow.  
The results are displayed in \ref{fig:Reasim}.

    \label{fig:Reasim}
\end{figure}
The same observations as noted for the previous figure can be made regarding the accuracy of \ref{eq:C_d_finalRe} at $\lambda = 0.1$ for high $Re$. 
In these figures, we highlight in more detail the differences between the results obtained for $Ga =5$ and for $Ga = 0$. 
Specifically, by comparing \ref{fig:Reasim} (dot dashed lines) and the case $Ga =5$ we observe that even at these low \textit{Galileo} numbers, the trends with the volume fraction already exhibit inertial effects. 
Indeed, our prediction at $Ga =5$ already exhibit large differences with the stokes prediction given by $(1-\phi)^{n(Re=0)}$. 
As predicted by \ref{eq:geenralizedh} at $Re \approx 1$ the behavior of $h$ lies between the Stokes and Newtonian regimes. 
This is well-supported by our numerical data, where, since at $Ga =5$, $Re$ ranges from $0.6$ to $1.6$ which precisely falls within this transitional zone. 
Thus, the good agreement with the numerical data for $Ga = 5$ serves as a validation for the arbitrary fit provided by \ref{eq:geenralizedh}. 

Note that the error in the rising velocity is bounded to $20\%$ for the worst cases, which is acceptable. 

In summary, the only arbitrary assumptions in relations \ref{eq:geenralizedh} and \ref{eq:final_n} for arbitrary $\lambda$ at $Re \ge 1$ seem to accurately represent the behavior observed in our numerical data. 
Hence, we can assert that \ref{eq:C_d_finalRe} remains physically consistent across the three-dimensional phase space defined by $\lambda$, $Re$ and $\phi$.
While minor improvements could be made to correct the results for the $\lambda = 0.1$ case, we chose not to overfit our data, maintaining a robust drag force model.
