@article{AGTEROF2003141,
 abstract = {For many food products emulsification processes play an important role. Examples are ice cream, spreads, sauces, etc. As is well known, droplet break-up and coalescence phenomena are the local processes underlying the control of particle size in an emulsion process. Quite a number of studies have generated scaling laws which can be easily applied and which are useful in the design of a process. However, the prediction of particle sizes in an inhomogeneous flow, where the flow velocity is changing spatially in strength and direction and with time, is not yet well established. For one-phase flows computational fluid dynamics (CFD) methodologies are in use to predict details on the flow with quite some success. This methodology has been extended to capture the dispersed phase in an efficient way. The essence is that break-up and coalescence processes determine source terms in a transport equation for the moments of the particle size distribution, while velocity vectors as obtained in the one-phase CFD simulation determine the convective term. This method allows particle size prediction in any equipment. The approach is illustrated for the particle size evolution of an oil-in-water emulsion, for a phase-separated biopolymeric mixture (a so-called water-in-water emulsion) and for the escape of the included oil droplets from a double emulsion of the type oil-in-water-in-oil. In all cases experimental results are compared with simulation results, which match very well. This shows the strength of the method.},

  abstract = {A phenomenological scheme is formulated for calculating the quasistatic Stokes force and torque on a rigid particle of any shape immersed in a flow field which tends to an arbitrary Stokes flow at infinity. This generalizes a previous result (Part III) limited to a uniform shear flow at infinity. The phenomenological resistance coefficients are shown to be constant polyadics which are intrinsic properties of the particle, dependent only on its external shape. In particular they are independent of the density, viscosity, and state of motion of the fluid. It is demonstrated that these coefficients can be computed solely from a knowledge of the solutions of Stokes equations for translational and rotational motions of the particle, along any three non-coplanar axes, in a fluid at rest at infinity. Explicit formulae for the polyadic coefficients are given for ellipsoidal and slightly deformed spherical particles.}

@article{KAMP20011363,
 abstract = {A mechanistic model for bubble coalescence in turbulent flow is presented. The model is developed in two steps, which are essentially separable. In the first, expressions put forward earlier for the collision frequency and coalescence probability of equal bubbles during turbulence-driven, high-Reynolds-number collisions are extended to unequal bubbles and to take account of bubble–turbulence and bubble–bubble interactions. In the second, the resulting expression for the coalescence rate is used to derive source terms in the transport equations for the moment densities of the bubble-diameter distribution, which can readily be evaluated locally within a CFD code. The result is an extremely compact framework capable of providing predictions of the evolution of bubble size distributions in space and time at the expense of only two additional scalar transport equations. To provide an experimental validation of the model, some data on the bubble size evolution along a pipe flow under microgravity conditions have been used. Microgravity experiments on gas–liquid bubbly pipe flows have been carried out during parabolic flights in aircraft. Bubble diameter distributions have been determined from high speed video recording and image processing. In the absence of gravity, collisions between bubbles smaller than the integral length scale of turbulence are primarily due to turbulence. The results from the calculation are in good agreement with the experimental data. The model is then used to predict the influence of the void fraction, the bubble size at the pipe inlet and the liquid mean velocity on the coalescence rate.},

 abstract = {There is an obvious need for obtaining a closed set of equations describing multiphase flows and the complexity of their configurations. Despite their “frozen” interfaces, suspensions of rigid particles are also concerned by this issue. The description of the relative motion between the two phases is still controversial, in particular, concerning the forces acting on the particles and involving their concentration gradient or a shear rate gradient. It is our purpose here (a) to develop a two-fluid model especially designed for particles dispersed in a viscous liquid and (b) to close the model for rigid particles with the help of low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics. Besides the obvious role of gravity forces, the migration of particles relative to the fluid is shown to result from two different physical phenomena: (a) the inhomogeneity of the stress resulting from direct interparticle forces and (b) Fick-like terms in the hydrodynamic force acting on the particles.},
