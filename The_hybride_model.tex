\begin{abstract}
This article provides a derivation of the averaged equations governing the motion of dispersed two-phase flows with interfacial transport. 
We begin by revisiting the two-fluid formulation, as well as the distributional form of the interfacial transport equation which holds on the entire domain. 
Following this, a general Lagrangian model is introduced, which accounts for the effects of both internal and interfacial properties of the dispersed inclusions (bubbles, droplets, or particles) within a continuous phase.
This is achieved by derivation of conservation laws for particle surface and volume-integrated properties. 
By summing the internal and interfacial conservation laws, we derive a conservation equation for an arbitrary Lagrangian property associated with the inclusion. 
% The key advantage of this formulation is that the non-convective flux inside the inclusion does not appear in the conservation law. 
Notably, the non-convective flux inside the inclusion and of the interface does not appear in the conservation law using this formulation. 
%We then proceed to derive the the lesser-known conservation equations for the moments related to an arbitrary Lagrangian property.
We then proceed by deriving the lesser-known conservation equations for the moments of the volume and surface distribution of an arbitrary Lagrangian property.  
Next, the averaged equations for the dispersed phase are derived through two distinct approaches: the particle-averaged (or Lagrangian) formalism, and the phase-averaged method. 
One important conclusion of this work is the demonstration of the relationship between the particle-averaged and phase-averaged equations. 
We show that the dispersed phase-averaged equations can be interpreted as a series expansion of the particle-averaged moment equations. 
The paper concludes by presenting a "hybrid" set of equations, consisting of phase-averaged equations for the continuous fluid phase, complemented by an arbitrary number of moment conservation equations for the dispersed phase.
