\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    This article presents a comprehensive study of the averaged equations for dispersed multiphase flows.
    We present a systematic derivation of a general averaged hybrid model that incorporates the influence of internal properties and surface properties of arbitrary particles dispersed in a continuous phase.
    The dispersed phase averaged equations are derived using two distinct formalism :
    the particle-average or Lagrangian formalism proposed by \citet{zhang1994ensemble,jackson1997locally};
    and the phase-average method, which is also employed for the continuous phase based on the approach of \citet{drew1983mathematical}. 
    The particle-phase averaged formalism yields the conventional linear conservation equations, as well as the less familiar moments' conservation equations.
    The primary contribution of this work is the demonstration of the equivalence between the particle-averaged and phase-averaged equations. 
    We show that the phase-averaged equation of the dispersed phase, is in fact a series expansion of the so-called particle-averaged moments equations. 
    The second contribution of this work is the derivation of linear and moments equations of the particle phase in their most generalized form. 
    The ambition of the manuscript is to provide a set of equation adaptable to any kind of flow and discuss the various form it can take depending on the particle nature.
