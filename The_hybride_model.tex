\begin{abstract}
This article provides a derivation of the averaged equations governing the motion of dispersed two-phase flows with interfacial transport. 
We begin by revisiting the two-fluid formulation, as well as the distributional form of the interfacial transport equation. 
Following this, a general Lagrangian model is introduced, which accounts for the effects of both internal and interfacial properties of the dispersed inclusions (bubbles, droplets, or particles) within a continuous phase.
By summing the internal and interfacial conservation laws, we derive a conservation equation for an arbitrary Lagrangian property associated with the inclusion. 
The key advantage of this formulation is that the non-convective flux inside the inclusion does not appear in the conservation law. 
%We then proceed to derive the the lesser-known conservation equations for the moments related to an arbitrary Lagrangian property.
We then proceed by deriving the lesser-known conservation equations for the moments associated with an arbitrary Lagrangian property.  
Next, the averaged equations for the dispersed phase are derived through two distinct approaches: the particle-averaged (or Lagrangian) formalism, and the phase-averaged method. 
%The particle-averaged formalism produces both the standard linear conservation equations and .
One of the primary conclusions of this work is the demonstration of the equivalence between the particle-averaged and phase-averaged equations. 
We show that the dispersed phase-averaged equations can be interpreted as a series expansion of the particle-averaged moment equations. 
The paper concludes by presenting a "hybrid" set of equations, consisting of phase-averaged equations for the continuous fluid phase, complemented by an arbitrary number of moment conservation equations for the dispersed phase.
    %This article presents a comprehensive study of the averaged equations describing the motion of dispersed two-phase flow with interfacial transport.
    %We first revisit the two-fluid formulation as well at the distributional form of the interfacial transport equation.
    %Then we present a general lagrangian model that incorporates the influence of internal properties and surface properties of inclusion (bubbles, drops or particles) dispersed in a continuous phase.
    %By summing both internal and surface conservation laws we derive the conservation equation for arbitrary Lagrangian property related to the inclusion. 
    %The main advantage of this conservation law is that the non-convective flux wihtin the inclusion does not appear in the conservation law. 
    %We then consider the higher moment equatiotns related to each quantity.
    %Then, the dispersed phase averaged equations are derived using two distinct formalism :
    %the particle-average or Lagrangian formalism proposed by \citet{zhang1994ensemble,jackson1997locally};
    %and the phase-average method.%, which is also employed for the continuous phase based on the approach of \citet{drew1983mathematical}. 
    %The particle-phase averaged formalism yields the conventional linear conservation equations, as well as the less familiar moments' conservation equations.
    %ONe the main conclusion of this work is the demonstration of the equivalence between the particle-averaged and phase-averaged equations. 
    %We show that the dispersed phase-averaged equation, is in fact a series expansion of the so-called particle-averaged moments equations. 
    %We end the paper by presenting the "hybrid" set of equations made of phase averaged equation for the fluid pahse completed by an arbitrary number of equations for the dispersed phase,representing the conservation of the moments.
    %The second contribution of this work is the derivation of the arbirary order moment equations of the particle phase in their most generalized form. 
    %The ambition of the manuscript is to provide a set of equation adaptable to any kind of dispersed two phase flow and discuss the various form it can take depending on the particle nature.

%In this work we provided a well-developed hybrid model for dispersed two phase flow made of fluid particles.
%The main contribution of the work is the derivation of a generalized formulation of what is called a \textit{Hybrid model} for dispersed two phase flows. 
%This model it is derived in the most general way incorporating volume and surface property of the particles.

%After averaging the equations that govern the dispersed phase using two distinct frameworks, namely, the phase-average and the particle-average, we demonstrated the equivalence between both formalism. 
%In light of \ref{eq:scheme_equivalence} we reached the major conclusion of this work, i.e.  the phase-averaged equation for the dispersed phase, is a series expansion of the particle-averaged equations.  
%As expected by several authors \citep{zhang1997momentum,nott2011suspension} it is therefore possible to describe a particle with an arbitrary order of accuracy by using the moments equations of a particle. 
%In this work we provided the general form of these equations together with a clear physical explanation of the moment equations. 
%This statement is only true if one assume that the Taylor series used in the process are convergent within the particles domains. 

% Acknowledging this fact we concluded that  any physical phenomenon could be modeled with the moments equations since they constitute the phase-averaged equation, i.e. \ref{eq:avg_dt_chi_f} with $k =2$. 
%The final system of equation, from \ref{eq:avg_hybrid_dt_chi_f} to \ref{eq:avg_hybrid_q_1} is constituted of a conservation equation for the continuous phase averaged quantity $f_f$, and $n$ dispersed phase equations for the moments $\textbf{q}_p^{(n)}$. 
%The equations for the moments $\textbf{q}_p^{(n)}$ posses each a well-defined physical sense that are related to the moment of the distribution of the local quantity $\chi_df_d^0 + \delta_\Gamma f_\Gamma^0$ inside the particles. 
%Then, we clarified the role of the non-convective fluxes on the dispersed phase properties. 

%Overall, the main advancement of this model is its ability to incorporate the effects of the particles' surface properties within the Lagrangian balance laws of arbitrary order, and provides a framework for deriving particle-average equations tailored to any type of problem.
