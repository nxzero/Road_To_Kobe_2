Buoyancy-driven droplet flows are encountered in many chemical engineering processes such as gravity separators and liquid-liquid extractors. 
The usual engineering practice to model such facilities is to use the averaged Navier-Stokes equations. 
The present work focuses on the velocity fluctuations tensor, also known as the \textit{Reynolds stress} tensor, or Pseudo-turbulent tensor, which is a crucial closure term in these equations.
Formally, this stress is defined as $\avg{ \textbf{u}' \textbf{u}'}_f$, where $\textbf{u}'$ is the fluid velocity fluctuation, and $\avg{\ldots}_f$ denotes an ensemble average procedure applied over the continuous phase. 
The \textit{Reynolds stress} can be separated into two contributions : (1) The agitation generated due to the averaged wakes around the particles; (2) All other sources of fluctuations, such as those generated through particle interactions, and single-phase turbulence \cite{du2022analysis}.
This study only considers the first contribution. 
Specifically we compute $\avg{ \textbf{u}' \textbf{u}'}_f$, for buoyant rising droplets in an otherwise quiescent fluid. 
The derivation is restricted to spherical droplets (of radius $a$), at small particle Reynolds number, and low particle volume fraction ($\phi$). 


For buoyant inviscid bubbly flows under the dilute assumption, it is known since the study of \cite{van1982bubble} that the \textit{Reynolds stress} can be written as
\begin{equation}
    \avg{\textbf{u}'\textbf{u}'}_f (\textbf{x})
    \approx
    n_p \int_{|\textbf{r}| > a}\textbf{v}\textbf{v}  d\textbf{r}
    = \phi \left(\frac{3}{20} U^2\textbf{I} + \frac{1}{20} \textbf{UU} \right),
    % \\+\underbrace{\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \textbf{R} P_{f}^1(\textbf{x},\textbf{r}) d\textbf{r}}_\text{(2)}
    % - \phi_f \textbf{u}_f\textbf{u}_f,
    \label{eq1}
\end{equation}
where $n_p$ is the number of particles per unit of volume, $\textbf{U}$ is the averaged particle velocity, and $\textbf{v}$ is the disturbance velocity field of an isolated particle. 
The integral in Equation (\ref{eq1}) could be computed since $\textbf{v} \sim \mathcal{O}(r^{-3})$, with $r =|\textbf{r}|$ in the case of potential flows. 
However, the disturbance velocity field of a translating droplet in Stokes flows (see Figure \ref{fig:wake}) decays as $\sim \mathcal{O}(r^{-1})$. 
Therefore, the integral in Equation (\ref{eq1}) cannot be computed for Stokes flows. 
This is the main reason why no theoretical model exists for $\avg{\textbf{u}'\textbf{u}'}_f$ in the limit of low Reynolds number. 

To bypass the problem of divergent integrals we make use of the  \textit{Nearest Particle Statistics} framework recently revisited by \cite{zhang2021ensemble}. 
In this context we can express the \textit{Reynolds stress} in terms of nearest-particles averaged quantities, which yields
\begin{equation*}
    \avg{\textbf{u}'\textbf{u}'}_f(\textbf{x},t)
    \approx
    \int_{r >a}  \textbf{v}  \textbf{v} P_\text{nst}^f(\textbf{r}|\textbf{x},t) d\textbf{r}.
\end{equation*}
Where $P_\text{nst}^f(\textbf{r}|\textbf{x},t)$ is the probability that the nearest particle's center of mass is located at \textbf{r}, conditionally on the point \textbf{x} being occupied by the continuous phase.
In the homogeneous and dilute regime $P_\text{nst}^f(\textbf{r}|\textbf{x},t) = n_p e^{- \phi [(r/a)^3 - 8]}$ \cite{zhang2021ensemble}.
The rapid decay of $P_\text{nst}^f$ at large $r$ enables us to compute the integral of the disturbance velocity fields even in low inertia regimes. 
Carrying out the integration yields directly 
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\avg{\textbf{u}'_y\textbf{u}'_y}_f}{U^2}
    = \frac{\phi}{5(\lambda +1)^2}\left[
        \frac{7 \Gamma\left(1/3\right)}{12}(3\lambda+2)^2    \phi^{-1/3}
        - (17\lambda^2+22\lambda+7)
        \right]
        + \mathcal{O}(\phi^{4/3})
        \label{eq:results}
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma(1/3) = \int_0^\infty t^{z-1} e^{-t} dt$ is the Gamma function with $\Gamma(1/3)= 2.678$, $\lambda$ is the viscosity ratio between the dispersed and continuous phase, and $y$ is the direction of gravity.

    \label{fig:wake}
\end{figure}
As can be observed on Figure \ref{fig:wake}, the present theory is in very good agreement with the experimental results of \cite{cartellier2009induced}.  
Direct numerical simulations of rising buoyant emulsions have also been performed (with the code \url{http://basilisk.fr}) for $\lambda = 0.1,1,10$. Good agreement is also obtained. 

In conclusion we provided a \textit{Reynolds stress} closure valid in the dilute Stokes flow regime for arbitrary viscosity ratios.
