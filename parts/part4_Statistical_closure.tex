\section{Statistical closure}

Consider doing machine learning to predict the collision normal velocity used in coalescence model

This way you can predict knowing the angle of attack the relative velocity or foces. 

INPUT, pos angle and Ga Phi. 
input learned through statisticla arguments. 

OUT, Rel vel and forces.
