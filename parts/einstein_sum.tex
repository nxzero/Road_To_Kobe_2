\subsection{ Einstein summation notation}

This header file contains the functions related to the Einstein summation macro implemented by the $\texttt{Basilisk C}$ preprocessor. This macro allows the user to write tensor algebra in index notation using $\texttt{Basilisk C}$ code. The syntax follows the famous \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein\_notation}{Einstein summation convention}.

\subsubsection{ Mathematical definitions}

Let us give the basis of the Einstein summation convention through the example of a simple scalar product between two second-order tensors in $3D$ space. In mathematics and physics, it is customary to write second-order tensors as $\textbf{A} = \sum_{i,j = 1}^3 A_{ij} \bm e_i\bm e_j$ where $\bm e_i$ and $\bm e_j$ are basis vectors in $3D$ space and $A_{ij}$ is the component of the tensor $\textbf A$ projected on the vectors $\bm e_i\bm e_j$. In tensor notation the inner product between two arbitrary second-order tensors: $\textbf{A}$ and $\textbf{B}$, can be written as $\textbf{C} =  \textbf{A}\cdot\textbf{B}$. If the basis is orthonormal, the components of the tensor $\textbf C$ are given by
$$ C_{ij} = \sum_{k=1}^3 A_{ik} B_{kj}.$$
Since the summation operator can be quite cumbersome in the Einstein summation convention we rewrite this operation as
$$ C_{ij} = A_{ik} B_{kj} $$
where the summation over $k$ from $1$ to $3$ is implicit.
We took the example of a simple scalar product, nevertheless note that this notation extends to any tensor operations which can be much more complex.   
Therefore, to remove any ambiguity in the Einstein summation notation, one has to follow the following rules:
1. each index can appear at most twice in any term,
2. repeated indices are implicitly summed over,
3. each term must contain identical non-repeated indices.

For example the expression: $M_{ij}v_iv_j$ is valid and indicate a double summation over $i$ and $j$, 
while the rexpression $M_{ij}v_ju_j$ is ambigous since the index $j$ appears $3$ times. 
For a more complete and rigourous definition of the Einstein summation convention we recommand the Wikipedia page: \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein\_notation}{Einstein summation convention}.

\subsubsection{ User interface}

To write a scalar product in $\texttt{Basilisk C}$ one needs first to define vector and second-order tensor-like structures. The default vector structure is the `coord` struct. The second or higher-order structures must be defined by the user. 

\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor = \color{lightgray},
 language = C,
 xleftmargin = 2cm,
 framexleftmargin = 1em]
typedef struct {
coord x,y,z;
} mytensor;
mytensor A,B,C; 
\end{lstlisting}

Note that the name `mytensor` is arbitrary. However, the name of the structure members must be $x$, $y$ and $z$. Following the Einstein summation convention the scalar product introduced in the previous paragraph can be written in $\texttt{Basilisk C}$ as

\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor = \color{lightgray},
 language = C,
 xleftmargin = 2cm,
 framexleftmargin = 1em]
einstein_sum(i,j,k) {
  C.i.j = A.i.k*B.k.j; 
}
\end{lstlisting}

With this macro, the preprocessor of $\texttt{Basilisk C}$ interprets all lines of code within the braces as tensor operations. The letters given within the parenthesis indicate the indices on which the Einstein summation takes place. In this case a summation will be applied on the index $k$ and permutations will be performed on the indices $i$ and $j$. 
To verify that the $\texttt{Basilisk C}$ preprocessor gives the desired results, one can precompile the $\texttt{Basilisk C}$ file with the command line

\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor = \color{lightgray},
   language = bash,
   xleftmargin = 2cm,
   framexleftmargin = 1em]
qcc -source my_file.c
\end{lstlisting}

The results of the precompilation stored in \texttt{\_my\_file.c} will be

\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor = \color{lightgray},
 language = C,
 xleftmargin = 2cm,
 framexleftmargin = 1em]
{
  C.x.x = A.x.x*B.x.x+ A.x.y*B.y.x+ A.x.z*B.z.x;
  C.x.y = A.x.x*B.x.y+ A.x.y*B.y.y+ A.x.z*B.z.y;
  C.x.z = A.x.x*B.x.z+ A.x.y*B.y.z+ A.x.z*B.z.z;
  C.y.x = A.y.x*B.x.x+ A.y.y*B.y.x+ A.y.z*B.z.x;
  C.y.y = A.y.x*B.x.y+ A.y.y*B.y.y+ A.y.z*B.z.y;
  C.y.z = A.y.x*B.x.z+ A.y.y*B.y.z+ A.y.z*B.z.z;
  C.z.x = A.z.x*B.x.x+ A.z.y*B.y.x+ A.z.z*B.z.x;
  C.z.y = A.z.x*B.x.y+ A.z.y*B.y.y+ A.z.z*B.z.y;
  C.z.z = A.z.x*B.x.z+ A.z.y*B.y.z+ A.z.z*B.z.z;
}
\end{lstlisting}

Note that the preprocessor duplicated the lines for each permutation of $i$ and $j$ and applied a summation over the index $k$. This macro also applies to $\texttt{Basilisk C}$ vector fields (such as the velocity field `u.x[]`) and any other user-defined structures with members named $x$, $y$ and $z$.

For higher-order rank tensors one can note that these expressions become quite cumbersome.
It is for that reason that the \texttt{einstein\_sum} macro has been created. 
For more examples one can check the test file \href{einstein\_sum.c}{/src/test/einstein\_sum.c}.

\subsubsection{Specific cases}

As long as the user follows the rules mentioned above, the desired result will be obtained. 
However, the \texttt{einstein\_sum} macro is somewhat more permissive than the original rules of the convention. 
For example the code

\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor = \color{lightgray},
 language = C,
 xleftmargin = 2cm,
 framexleftmargin = 1em]
U.i = M.i.j*u.j*v.j;
\end{lstlisting}

which is **not defined correctly** will still be compiled, and in $2D$ will give

\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor = \color{lightgray},
 language = C,
 xleftmargin = 2cm,
 framexleftmargin = 1em]
U.x = M.x.x*u.x*v.x + M.x.y*u.y*v.y;
U.y = M.y.x*u.x*v.x + M.y.y*u.y*v.y;
\end{lstlisting}

The use of C functions within the macro is also allowed. 
Let `function(args)` be an arbitrary C function. 
Then the expression, 

\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor = \color{lightgray},
 language = C,
 xleftmargin = 2cm,
 framexleftmargin = 1em]
U.i = function (M.i.j*u.j*v.j);
\end{lstlisting}

will be expanded to

\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor = \color{lightgray},
 language = C,
 xleftmargin = 2cm,
 framexleftmargin = 1em]
U.x = function (M.x.x*u.x*v.x + M.x.y*u.y*v.y);
U.y = function (M.y.x*u.x*v.x + M.y.y*u.y*v.y);
\end{lstlisting}

The summation is applied at the lowest level of the expression where all the indices that must be summed over are present. 
Here the summation takes place inside the parenthesis since all indices \texttt{j} are contained within them. 

A useful example of the use of a function is the computation of the L2 norm of the second-order tensor $\textbf C$

\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor = \color{lightgray},
 language = C,
 xleftmargin = 2cm,
 framexleftmargin = 1em]
L2 = sqrt (C.i.j*C.i.j);
\end{lstlisting}

Lastly, if no equality sign is identified, the preprocessor will not perform any summation operations. It will only carry the permutation on the current line of code. For example if one wants to print the content of a tensor one may write 

\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor = \color{lightgray},
 language = C,
 xleftmargin = 2cm,
 framexleftmargin = 1em]
einstein_sum (i,j) {
  fprintf (stderr, "%g\n", C.i.j);
}
\end{lstlisting}

which gives in $2D$

\begin{lstlisting}[backgroundcolor = \color{lightgray},
 language = C,
 xleftmargin = 2cm,
 framexleftmargin = 1em]
  fprintf (stderr, "%g\n", C.x.x);
  fprintf (stderr, "%g\n", C.x.y);
  fprintf (stderr, "%g\n", C.y.x);
  fprintf (stderr, "%g\n", C.y.y);
\end{lstlisting}

\subsubsection{Conclusion}

In summary the \texttt{einstein\_sum} macro follows the following steps:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item  It Identifies if a given line of code is an assignment expression with a "=" sign or not. 
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item If it is, it identifies the indices on the right and left-hand side of the expression. 
       It then carries a summation over the indices that appear only on the right-hand side. 
    \item If it is not an equality, it does nothing at this step. 
    \end{enumerate}
    \item  It then copies the lines of codes and carries permutations on the indices present on the line (excluding the one that has been summed over). 
    \item Steps 1. and 2. are repeated for all lines within the macro. 
\end{enumerate}

Note that these steps do not follow the original Einstein summation convention rules. 
Therefore, some expressions may be ambiguous and the user is advised to always check for the pre-compiler results using \texttt{qcc -source my\_file.c} before using the code.
