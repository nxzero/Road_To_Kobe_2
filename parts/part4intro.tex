\chapter{Investigation of the closure problem}
\label{chap:Model}
\tb{The project of this part is to develop theoretical models for the closures in a given limit, i.e. at low $Ga$. }
\tb{To derive the drag force in stokes flow we will make use of periodic green function and this will give rise to a full theoretical of the fluid particle stress}
\tb{the stresslet can be computed with the boundary integral method in the limit of low stokes number and dilute regime, might be interesting to use periodic green function}
\tb{add to this chapter some stokes equation found in the book \cite{kim2013microhydrodynamics} }
\tb{ get the surface equation closure from \citet{lhuillier2003dynamics}}
