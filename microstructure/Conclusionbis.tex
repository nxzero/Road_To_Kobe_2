\section{Conclusion}


In this study, we provided a numerical framework to perform statistically steady simulations of rising emulsions with non-coalescing droplets. 
We developed an optimized multi-VoF method within the \texttt{Basilisk} flow solver. 
It enabled us to avoid coalescence between an arbitrary number of droplets while keeping the number of tracers inferior or equal to $7$. 
Additionally, we showed that the multi-VoF method is capable of capturing the physics of interfacial interactions despite the coarse mesh definition at the scale of the film between the droplets, see \ref{ap:validation} (\textit{Case 2}). 
This enabled us to perform massive DNS calculations of rising mono-disperse emulsion with various $\lambda$, $\phi$, and $Ga$ for long durations.
