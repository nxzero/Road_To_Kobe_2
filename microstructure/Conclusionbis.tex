\section{Conclusion}


In this study, we provided a numerical framework to perform statistically steady simulations of rising emulsions with non-coalescing droplets. 
We developed an optimized multi-VoF method within the \texttt{Basilisk} flow solver. 
It enabled us to avoid coalescence between an arbitrary number of droplets while keeping the number of tracers inferior or equal to $7$ (for $\phi < 0.2$). 
Additionally, we showed that the multi-VoF method is capable of capturing the physics of interfacial interactions despite the coarse mesh definition at the scale of the film between the droplets, see \ref{ap:validation} (\textit{Case 2}). 
This enabled us to perform massive DNS calculations of rising mono-disperse emulsion with various $\lambda$, $\phi$, and $Ga$ for long durations.

We also provide three \texttt{YouTube} videos of typical DNS conducted in this work. 
The first one for an emulsion with $\phi = 0.01$, $\lambda = 1$, and $Ga = 50$: \href{https://youtube.com/shorts/R44HSADSUCc}{DNS 1}
The second one for $\phi=0.05$, $\lambda = 1$, and $Ga = 50$: \href{https://youtube.com/shorts/bGNlK2MV7p0}{DNS 2}. 
One can also find the DNS of \ref{ap:validation} (\textit{Case 2}) at \href{https://youtube.com/shorts/GhNfOf-Vbwo}{DNS 3}.
