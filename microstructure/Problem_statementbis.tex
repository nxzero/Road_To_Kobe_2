\section{Numerical methodology}
\label{sec:methodo}

If one wishes to build relevant statistics, he needs to conduct simulations of droplet flows for sufficient time to reach a statistically steady-state regime.
However, depending on the numerical method used, one may encounter difficulties in preventing coalescence between droplets which is necessary to reach a steady state regime.
Indeed, the Volume-of-Fluid (VoF) method, which is the method used in this work, is known to cause premature coalescence between droplets or bubbles \citep{innocenti2020direct}.
Several methods have been proposed to address this issue, including those by \citet{roghair2011drag,balcazar2015multiple,hidman2023assessing,zhang2023evolution}, and \citet{karnakov2022computing}.
These methods typically involve front-tracking, using a single volume-of-fluid tracer per droplet, or incorporating a numerical interfacial force to hinder coalescence. However, as detailed in the subsequent sections, these methods are only partially suitable for our objectives due to the potential introduction of non-physical behavior or excessive computational overhead. Consequently, we propose a novel algorithm to prevent coalescence, facilitating Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) over extended periods while maintaining a constant droplet population within a VoF framework.


This section outlines the approach employed for performing simulations to achieve statistically steady states simulations in the context of a rising mono-disperse suspension of droplets within a fully periodic domain.
We start by presenting the relevant physical parameters, followed by an overview of the numerical methods employed.
% Finally, we detail the methodology implemented for collecting statistical data on microstructure, which will be presented in the following sections.

%In this section we expose the strategy employed to conduct statistically steady state simulations of rising mono-disperse suspension of droplets in a fully periodic domain. 
%We start by introducing the physical parameter, followed by a description of the numerical methods.

\subsection{Problem statement}

We investigate numerically the dynamics of homogeneous mono-disperse emulsions subject to buoyancy forces in a fully periodic domain. 
The dispersed and continuous phases are considered Newtonian fluids defined by viscosity $\mu_d$ (resp. $\mu_f$) and density $\rho_d$ (resp. $\mu_f$).
Throughout this work, the subscript $_d$ and $_f$ indicate properties belonging to the dispersed and continuous phases, respectively. 
The interface between both fluids is considered infinitely thin, free of impurities, and characterized by a constant surface tension $\gamma$. %with a coefficient  is assumed. 
The density and viscosity will be considered constant in each phase.
In dimensionless form, this problem is completely characterized by six dimensionless parameters:  the viscosity and density ratio, $\lambda = \mu_d / \mu_f$ and $\zeta = \rho_d / \rho_f$,  
the \textit{Galileo} number, 
\begin{equation*}
    Ga =\frac{\sqrt{\rho_f(\rho_f - \rho_d) g d^3}}{\mu_f},
\end{equation*}
the \textit{Bond} number, 
\begin{equation*}
    Bo =\frac{(\rho_f - \rho_d) g d^2}{\gamma},
\end{equation*}
the number of droplets per domain $N_b$, and the dispersed phase volume fraction $\phi$. 
Here, $d$ represents the diameter of a sphere with the same volume as the droplets and $g$ denotes the acceleration of gravity.
The \textit{Galileo} number measures the strength of the buoyancy forces relative to the viscous forces, whereas the \textit{Bond} number evaluates the ratio between buoyancy and capillary forces. 

%To provide a brief overview of the range of interest for these numbers in an industrial context, let us consider the example of a vegetable oil/water system.
%In most liquid-liquid system encountered in industrial processes the diameter of the droplets lies in the range $d = [50 \mu \text{m}, 3 \text{mm}]$. To provide order of magnitude of the quantities of interest let us consider the example of a vegetable oil dispersed in water. The density and viscosity of the continuous phase are approximately $\rho_f = 1000 \text{kg/m}^3$ and $\mu_f = 10^{-3} \text{Pa.s}$, respectively. The density and viscosity of the dispersed phase are close to $\rho_d = 900 \text{kg/m}^3$ and $\mu_d = 10^{-2} \text{Pa.s}$, respectively.
%We consider the gravitational acceleration on earth, thus $g= 9.81 \text{m.s}^{-2}$.
In most liquid-liquid systems encountered in industrial processes, the droplet diameters typically range from 10 micrometers to a few millimeters. To illustrate the order of magnitude of the relevant quantities, consider a scenario where vegetable oil is dispersed in water. The continuous phase (water) has a density of approximately $\rho_f = 1000 \text{kg/m}^3$ and a viscosity of about $\mu_f = 10^{-3} \text{Pa.s}$. In contrast, the dispersed phase (vegetable oil) has a density close to $\rho_d = 900 \text{kg/m}^3$ and a viscosity around $\mu_d = 10^{-2} \text{Pa.s}$.
The surface tension of the oil/water system is approximately $\gamma = 0.05 \text{N.m}^{-1}$. The maximum allowable volume fraction is set at $\phi = 0.2$. Beyond this value, particles tend to coalesce easily, leading to a loss of the dispersed flow topology.%The maximum volume fraction is set to $\phi = 0.2$, indeed above such $\phi$ particles coalesce easily and the topology of the flow cannot be considered as dispersed anymore. %\citep{de2015gouttes}.

    \label{tab:parameters_exp}
\end{table}
\ref{tab:parameters_exp} gives the corresponding dimensionless parameters.  
Notice that the \textit{Bond number} is relatively low, indicating that the droplets are nearly spherical in these processes.
% Following \ref{tab:parameters_exp}, to approach real-life applications, we conducted DNS for four volume fractions, specifically $\phi = 0.01,0.05,0.1,0.2$.

% In contrast to most previous studies, we keep the number of droplets constant while changing the volume fraction $\phi$. 
% We then modify the domain size $\mathcal{L}$ accordingly. 
% This introduces another dimensionless parameter of interest: $\mathcal{L}/d$, which measures the confinement of the particles within the finite numerical domain. 
% This parameter is purely determined by $\phi$ and $N_b$, and will thus be refereed as a \textit{secondary parameter}.

% As mentioned, the \textit{Bond} numbers of our targeted application is very low.
% Therefore, the \textit{Bond} number is set to $Bo = 0.2$, and it will stay constant throughout this study.
% DNS with lower \textit{Bond} numbers become excessively expensive due to the restrictive capillary timestep constraint. 
% % However, we assert that for $Bo \leq 0.2$, the droplet shape essentially remains spherical, at least for small \textit{Galileo} numbers. 
% Additionally, the ratio between inertia and surface tension forces is given by the \textit{Weber} number, 
% \begin{equation*}
%     We = \frac{\rho U^2d}{\gamma}%\frac{Bo \cdot Re^2}{Ga},
% \end{equation*}
% %where $Re = \frac{\rho_f d U}{\mu_f}$ is the Reynolds number based on 
% where $U$ is the relative velocity which is the difference between the dispersed phase velocity and the continuous velocity. %drift velocity $U$ which is the difference between the dispersed phase velocity and the bulk velocity.
% %Values of \textit{Reynolds} numbers for each DNS are provided in \ref{ap:slip_vel} (\ref{fig:Reall}). 
% Extreme values of $We$ reached in these simulations are displayed in \ref{tab:simulations}. 
% It is clear that for $We=0.6$, we might expect some deformations; nevertheless, in most cases, $We$ stays below these values. 
% Consequently, whether in the viscous or inertial regimes, the droplets are expected to remain spherical according to the values of $Bo$ and $We$.
% This statement is verified in appendix \ref{ap:deformation}.%will be verified in \ref{sec:microstructure}. 

%Density and viscosity ratio of droplets in real life applications are reported in \citet[Figure 1.]{balla2020effect}.
%As depicted in \citet[Figure 1.]{balla2020effect}, the viscosity and density ratio of fluid-fluid systems range between, $\lambda \in [10^{-4} : 10^4]$ and $\zeta \in [10^{-1} : 10^1]$, respectively. 


% The study's primary objective is to investigate the microstructure through the nearest particle pair distribution function.
% Thus, obtaining a sufficient number of DNS samples is crucial to ensure statistical convergence. 
% Also, the physical quantities measured in the simulations must remain independent of the domain size. 
% Therefore, we use a number of particles per domain of $N_b = 125$, roughly what \citet{hidman2023assessing} used for their DNS of fully-periodic buoyant rising bubbles.
% Moreover, each DNS lasts for a time: $t^*_\text{end} = 1500 \sqrt{d/g}$.
% It is shown in \ref{ap:validation} that these parameters  are sufficient to obtain well converged statistics.

% This study presents DNS results with dimensionless parameters in ranges outlined in \ref{tab:simulations}.
% In summary, we investigated $5$ \textit{Galileo} number $Ga = 5,10,25,50,100$, $4$ different volume fractions $\phi = 0.01,0.05,0.1,0.2$, and two viscosity ratios $\lambda =1,10$ with $Bo = 0.2$ and $\zeta = 0.9$. 
%In this study we restrict our attention to a single density ratio, $\zeta = 0.9$.
%Regarding the viscosity ratio, we accomplished DNS for 2 different values, namely $\lambda = 1,10$.
%Lastly, to explore the effect of inertia on the microstructure, the \textit{Galileo} number will vary within the range $Ga \in [5,100]$.
% This makes a total of $40$ representative simulations of $N_b = 125$ droplets which last for $t= 1500 \sqrt{d/g}$. 


% The study's primary objective is to investigate the microstructure through the nearest particle pair distribution function.
% Thus, obtaining a sufficient number of DNS samples is crucial to ensure statistical convergence. 
% Also, the physical quantities measured in the simulations must remain independent of the domain size. 
% Therefore, we set $\mathcal{L}/d = 10$, which is roughly what \citet{hidman2023assessing} used for their DNS of fully-periodic buoyant rising bubbles.
% Likewise, we use a number of particles per domain of at least $N_b = 160$ for all our cases, which introduces the need for a larger domain ($\mathcal{L}/d = 20$) for the dilute cases. 
% Moreover, each DNS lasts for a time: $t^*_\text{end} = 400 \sqrt{d/g}$ for the larger domains ($\mathcal{L}/d=20$) and $t^*_\text{end} = 1000 \sqrt{d/g}$ for the smaller domain.
% It is shown in \ref{ap:validation} that these parameters are sufficient to obtain well converged statistics.

In summary, this work will present DNS with the following dimensionless parameters. 
We investigated $5$ \textit{Galileo} number $Ga = 5,10,25,50,80$, $4$ different volume fractions $\phi = 0.01,0.05,0.1,0.2$ with $Bo = 0.5,0.2$ and $\zeta = 0.9$. %In this study we restrict our attention to a single density ratio, $\zeta = 0.9$.
Regarding the viscosity ratio, we accomplished DNS for 2 different values, namely $\lambda = 1,10,0.1$.
The detailed parameters (number of droplets per domain, domain size, duration of the simulations etc\ldots) of each DNS will be described in the following chapters. 
Each study addresses a different aspect of the problem, allowing us to changes specific parameters relevant to that particular investigation.
Basically, we will use longer simulations for studies that require more statistical samples, hence changing some of these parameters.
