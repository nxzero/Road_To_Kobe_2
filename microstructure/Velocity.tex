In \ref{sec:microstructure} we have investigated the microstructure geometry, 
in \ref{sec:time} we have seen that the timescale governing both, the microstructure evolution and the particles pair relative properties can be described by the mean age $\tau_p$.   
We now give a visual representation of the nearest pair relative velocity in space to better understand how the relative kinematic behave.  
To that end we compute the nearest relative velocity and age  conditionally on the position \textbf{r}, namely,
\begin{align*}
    \textbf{w}^\text{r}_pP_r(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)
    =\int_0^\infty \textbf{w}^\text{nst}_pP_a(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t,a) da,\\
    a^rP_r(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)
    =\int_0^\infty a P_a(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t,a) da.
\end{align*}
The superscript $^\text{r}$ indicate that the quantity $\textbf{w}^\text{r}_p$ and $a^r$ is conditioned on the relative position \textbf{r}.   
Upon having a good estimation of this velocity and age mean fields one is able to reconstruct the history of the particles interactions in terms of relative velocity and mean age of interaction. 
To be able to visualize
$\textbf{w}^\text{r}_p(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)$
and 
$a^r(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)$
on 2D plots we consider an axis symmetry along the vertical axis and average the values of 
$\textbf{w}^\text{r}_p(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)$
and $a^r(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)$
on the polar coordinate, as it has been done for $P_\text{nst}$ in \ref{sec:microstructure}. 

\paragraph*{The impact of the Galileo number : }
The first effect that we study is the impact of the inertial effect on the particles relative kinematic.  
In \ref{fig:Why_Ga_matter} we display the velocity fields $\textbf{w}_p^r$ represented by the arrows that are colored by the mean dimensionless age $a^r$.  
On the left panel we can observe a low inertial case $Ga = 10$, on the right panel we display a highly inertial case $Ga=100$ both for $\lambda =1$ and $\phi=0.05$.
In the discussion below we refer to the sphere at the origin of the graph, located at \textbf{x}, as the \textit{test sphere}.

\end{figure}

The first aspect that we would like to clarify here is the non fore-after symmetry of the velocity fields $\textbf{w}_p^\text{nst}$. 
Indeed, in plots display on \ref{fig:Why_Ga_matter} we remark that the $\textbf{w}_p^\text{nst}$ exhibit a clear asymmetry with respect to the horizontal plane.
This is explained by the non commutativity of the function $h_{ij}$ in the indices $i$ and $j$ in \ref{eq:q_nstij}, as a result $\textbf{w}_p^r(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t) \neq \textbf{w}_p^r(\textbf{x} +  \textbf{r},0,t)$. 
This operator is not commutative, indeed as it is depicted on \ref{fig:diagram_asym}, in the cases were the neighboring nearest particle is far from the test particle, the chance for this particle to have another nearest neighbor which is closer is high. 
Note that this asymmetry would not be present if we had considered classic particle pair average as it is done in \cite{shajahan2023inertial}. 
That explains why the plots on \ref{fig:Why_Ga_matter} are not symmetrical when we observe the fields at sufficiently large distance $|\textbf{r}|$. 
To summaries, in the situation where we observe $\textbf{w}_p^r$ for large $|\textbf{r}|$ the test particle can be considered as being \textit{isolated}, as its nearest neighbor is at a large distance $|\textbf{r}|$ from the test particle. 
Additionally, the nearest neighboring particle, if located far enough, has 
potentially a nearest neighbor that is closer than the test sphere, as explained on \ref{fig:diagram_asym}. 
Consequently, provided that the nearest neighbor of the test sphere is far enough, we can be sure that in average it approach a pair of particles or more, that are packed together.

        Since $|\textbf{r}|/d$ is assumed to be large, the nearest neighbor of the particle $p_2$ is more likely to be another nearest neighbor than $p_1$ such as the particle $p_3$, which is closer.
        This is due to the rapid decay of $P_\text{nst}$ for large $|\textbf{r}|/d$, see \ref{fig:Pnst_high_Ga}. 
        In these cases the nearest neighbor of $p_1$ is $p_2$, but the contrary is not true inducing asymmetry in the statistics.

\end{figure}

Now that this matter is clarified we can start to interpret the plots of \ref{fig:Why_Ga_matter}. 
The beginning of the interactions happen at the early ages, meaning in the dark blue areas, which are located on the top or bottom of the particle of reference, the end of interactions corresponds to the greater ages, which are represented by the red areas. 
As shown by \ref{fig:Why_Ga_matter} (left), at low \textit{Galileo} number the nearest particle has a tendency to come from the top or bottom and leave through the sides. 
If the nearest particle is at a reasonable distance $|\textbf{r}| < 1.5d$ on the sides of the test particle, we can see that the relative velocity is in average null on the vertical components, but positive in the radial component.
In this area, the age is at its maximum (dark red zone), therefore the interaction to an end, meaning that the nearest particles get replace by another. 
Notice that the particles at a larger distance of the test particle, say $|\textbf{r}|>2$, have an averaged positive vertical velocity. 
As discussed above, in this situation the neighbor on the side is more likely to be closer to another particle. 
Consequently, if the test particle is isolated, with neighboring particles on the side but sufficiently far, it will rise in average with a lower velocity than the latter particles.
Thus, particles at contact  seems to get apart because of the non-null radial velocity, and particle at distance seems to get apart because of the non-null vertical velocity.  
Consequently, in average the side-by-side configuration is not stable at these \textit{Galileo} number, which partly explain why the particle distribution doesn't form any layer or such oriented microstructure at these $Ga$.   

% A plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that the leading particle accelerate the trailing particle with its wake on a first stage. 
% Then, the trailing particle arise to the same altitude as the leading particle, but still goes faster than the leading particle due to the acceleration provided by the wake of the latter particle.
% If the particles get in contact then the interaction duration seem to last longer, and the particles might even get trap in a small stagnation zone on the side of the particles.


For high \textit{Galileo} number, see \ref{fig:Why_Ga_matter} (right), the relative averaged velocity is nearly null on the sides and below the test particle. 
Nevertheless, it is a statistical representation, meaning that $\textbf{w}_p^r = 0$ just witnesses of the fact that the particles' relative velocity are not correlated in the area. 
The particles at a large distance on the top of the test particle have a downward velocity. 
Meaning that if the test sphere is isolated and approach one or several  particles on the top of it (see \ref{fig:diagram_asym} (\textit{Case 1})), it will eventually catch up the latter particles. 
On the contrary, if the particle is isolated and that the nearest neighbor is at the bottom (see \ref{fig:diagram_asym} (\textit{Case 2})), the velocity is either pointing downward, or it is not correlated as indicated by the magnitude of $\textbf{w}_p^r$. 
A plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that the reference particle when being isolated goes faster than the potentially packed nearest neighbor.
Thus, the test sphere can either catch the nearest particle if it is above, or getting apart from it if it is below.
Also, it is interesting to notice that in this case the particles at near contact on the bottom of the test particles results from early interaction, denoted by the dark blue zone. 
It can be interpreted as follows : since 
initial time of interaction is in average low in this zone, it does mean that particles replace an old nearest neighbor that where at near contact of the test particles. 
Thus, in this case the nearest neighbor reaches the test sphere which were rising slowly because of a close neighbor. 

Ultimately, the fields $\textbf{w}^r_p(\textbf{x},\textbf{r}, a)$ provide a quantitative averaged representation of what is known as the \textit{Drafting Kissing Tumbling} \citep{fortes1987nonlinear} mechanism when the particles come at near contact. 
Indeed, in both case they eventually approach from the verticals (\textit{Drafting}), nearly touch each other (\textit{Kissing}), and leave through the sides (\textit{Tumbling}). 
Statistically, specking the \textit{Tumbling} part isn't present in the high inertial case which might leads to the creation of anisotropic structures. 
For $\lambda = 1$ other non-viscous effects may be important \citet{legendre2003hydrodynamic}, but it will be discarded for now.

To support the deduction made above we displayed in \ref{fig:unst_ga} the nearest neighbor conditioned averaged center of mass velocity, $\textbf{u}_p^r$ defined as,
\begin{equation*}
    \textbf{u}^\text{r}_p P_r(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)
    =\int_0^\infty \textbf{u}^\text{nst}_pP_a(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t,a) da
\end{equation*}
In \ref{fig:unst_ga} (left) we clearly see that the magnitude of the test particle velocity is higher than the particle phase velocity $\textbf{u}_p$ when the nearest neighbor is at near contact of the test particle, either above or below.
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[height=0.35\textwidth]{image/HOMOGENEOUS_NEW/Dist/U_l_1_Ga_10_PHI_5.pdf}

        (right) High \textit{Galileo} number $Ga = 100$.
         }
    \label{fig:unst_ga}
\end{figure}
When the nearest neighbor is at large distance of the test particle, its average velocity is lower $\textbf{u}_p$. 
At high inertia however, the test particle velocity is higher when being isolated than with its neighbor at near contact. 
Additionally, we can see that when the particle is on the side at near contact or below the velocity of the test sphere is lower than the mean. 
In brief in the case of $Ga = 10$ it seems that isolated particles goes slower than close neighbors at are at the same altitude of test particles. 
While at higher \textit{Galileo} number it is the opposite, we observe that isolated particles  goes faster than packed neighbor. 
Consequently, isolated particles are able to caught up packed of particle which rise slower, ultimately forming cluster. 



\paragraph*{The volume fraction dependency :}
As it has been observed in both \ref{fig:A} the effect of an increasing particle volume fraction is that it makes the particle distribution slightly more isotropic when $\phi >0.1$. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=0.35\textwidth]{image/HOMOGENEOUS_NEW/Dist/U_rel_l_1_Ga_100_PHI_5.pdf}

    (left) Low \textit{Galileo} number $\phi = 0.05$.
    (right) High \textit{Galileo} number $\phi = 0.2$. }
    \label{fig:Why_Phi_matter}
\end{figure}
In \ref{fig:Why_Phi_matter} both graph exhibit the same shapes even if the length scales changes due to the change in volume fraction. 
Indeed, the stagnation zones with dark red color and the particle at resulting from short interactions, dark blue color, are located approximately at the same location. 
We still observe an asymmetry on the horizontal plane as it was discussed above. 
For other $\lambda$ and $Ga$ no particular differences could be observed varying $\phi$. 
Overall, even if small differences might be present the change in volume fraction doesn't seem to affect the kinematic of interaction between particles. 

\paragraph*{The viscosity ratio dependency :}
Lastly, we turn our attention to the effect of the viscosity ratio on pair interactions.
The question that we are trying to answer is : why does a smaller viscosity ratio increase the anisotropy of the tensor $\textbf{R}(\textbf{x},t)$ as it is shown in \ref{fig:A}. 
The question is investigated comparing two cases at $Ga = 100$, where we observe a clear difference between the PDF (see \ref{fig:Pnst_high_Ga}) for $\lambda = 1$ and  $\lambda = 10$.

    (left) High viscosity ratio $\lambda = 10$.
    (right) Low viscosity ratio, $\lambda = 1$. }
    \label{fig:Why_l_matter}
\end{figure}
As in the previous cases, it is clear that for both cases in \ref{fig:Why_l_matter} the neighboring particle approach on the vertical direction and end up its course on the sides.
As discussed previously, the case on \ref{fig:Why_l_matter} (right) exhibit a clear stagnation zone and asymmetry on a vertical plane. 
On the other hand for $\lambda =10$ the relative velocity on the vicinity of the particle seem to be in average positive in the radial direction. 
The asymmetry aforementioned is not present in this case. 
As discussed in the previous paragraph, and explained by \ref{fig:diagram_asym}, the presence of the skew asymmetry in the fields $\textbf{w}_p^\text{r}$ about horizontal plane, witnesses for collective interactions of the far nearest neighbor with other closer particles. 

As before it is interesting to investigate the value of the conditional velocity $\textbf{u}^r_p$ to better understand the particles collective interaction. 
Thus, \ref{fig:unst_l} display the fields  $\textbf{u}_p^\text{r}$ for both cases. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=0.35\textwidth]{image/HOMOGENEOUS_NEW/Dist/U_l_10_Ga_100_PHI_5.pdf}

         (left) High viscosity ratio $\lambda = 10$.
         (right) Low viscosity ratio, $\lambda = 1$.
         }
    \label{fig:unst_l}
\end{figure}
On \ref{fig:unst_l} (left) we first notice that $\textbf{u}^\text{r}(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)$ behave similarly as the low inertial case display on \ref{fig:unst_ga} (left).
However, in high viscosity ratio case, the isolated particles' velocity is roughly equal to $\textbf{u}_p$, it is not necessarily slower than the mean. 
In fact $\textbf{u}^\text{r}(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)$ seems uncorrelated with \textbf{r} when $|\textbf{r}| /d >1.5$. 
For $\lambda = 10$ if isolated particle rise at the average velocity it is because the isolated particles constitute the majority of the realization since the trace of \textbf{R} is rather high, see \ref{fig:A}.
Therefore, this fact is not particularly relevant as it is just a statistical bias. 
Nevertheless, we can still conclude that for $\lambda = 10$ particles goes faster with a nearest neighbor on top or bottom, while for  $\lambda = 1$ particles goes faster when the nearest neighbor is at large distance. 


\paragraph*{Discussion :}
From \ref{sec:time} we demonstrated that the microstructure tensor \textbf{R} is a function of the tensor $\textbf{W}$, which might be expressed as the symmetric part of $\int_0^\infty \textbf{r} \textbf{w}_p^\text{r} P(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t) da$. 
Thus, the trends of the $\textbf{w}_p^\text{r}$ in terms of the position presented in this section partly determine the final value of \textbf{R}. 
In most of the graphs we observed that the vertical components of $\textbf{w}_p^\text{r}$ where negative when the vertical component of where positive \textbf{r} and inversely. 
Consequently, $W_{yy}$ must be in average negative, which ultimately contribute to the value of \textbf{R} and \textbf{A} through \ref{eq:dt_R} and justify the sign of $A_{xx}$ in \ref{fig:A}. 

On a different note, we now ask this question : 
Is the relative velocity fields $\textbf{w}_p^r$ the cause of the microstructure's shape as it is suggested by \ref{eq:dt_R}. 
Or does the microstructure impose the relative velocity field as it could be through looking at the previous graphs ?
Indeed, on \ref{fig:Why_l_matter} (right), the clear asymmetry can be understood as the consequence of cluster in the flows, which rises slower than the isolated particles. 
Although it is tedious question, we believe that both are true, even if physical parameters also impact $\textbf{w}_p^r$, which makes the microstructure case dependent.  
Nevertheless, this makes \textbf{W} potentially a function of \textbf{R}.
Thus, a more efficient way to close \textbf{W} by an objective manner would be to study the dynamic of interactions. 
Indeed, in this work we only provided a kinematics arguments to explain the microstructure shape. 
Of course to fully understand the physics one has to study the dynamic of interaction. 
It is in fact possible in our framework to include such dynamic variable by deriving an equation for \textbf{W} the same way we derived \ref{eq:dt_R} for \textbf{R}.
In this case it is reasonable to believe that the closure terms for the dynamical equation will not be microstructure dependent but rather function of the physical parameters.
