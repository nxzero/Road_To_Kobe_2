% Objective of this section :
% \begin{itemize}
    % \item Introduce the dimensionless parameters.
    % \item Present the physical parameters of some industrial processes to locate our problematic.

We investigate numerically the dynamic of homogeneous mono-disperse emulsion subject to buoyancy forces in a fully periodic domain. 
Both, the dispersed (resp. continuous) phase is considered as Newtonian fluid defined by viscosity $\mu_d$ (resp. $\mu_f$), and density $\rho_d$ (resp. $\mu_f$).
Throughout this work, the subscript $_d$ and $_f$ indicate properties belonging to the dispersed and continuous phase, respectively. 
The interface between both fluids is considered as infinitely thin and deprived of any impurities, it is described with the surface tension coefficient $\gamma$. 
In this work the density, viscosity, and surface tension coefficient, will be considered constant in each phase.
In dimensionless form this problem is completely characterized by $6$ dimensionless parameters :  the viscosity and density ratio, $\lambda = \mu_d / \mu_f$ and $\zeta = \rho_d / \rho_f$,  
the \textit{Galileo} number, 
\begin{equation*}
    Ga =\sqrt{\rho_f(\rho_f - \rho_d) g d^3} / \mu_f,
\end{equation*}
the \textit{Bond} number, 
\begin{equation*}
    Bo =\frac{(\rho_f - \rho_d) g d^2}{\gamma},
\end{equation*}
the number of droplets per domain $N_b$, and the dispersed phase volume fraction $\phi$. 
Here, $d$ represents the diameter of a sphere with the same volume as the droplets, and $g$ denotes the gravitational acceleration.
The \textit{Galileo} number measure the influence of the buoyancy forces against the viscous forces.
Whereas the \textit{Bond} number evaluate the ratio between buoyancy and capillary forces. 
% These parameters are the input parameters that we set at the beginning of a simulation

To provide a brief overview of the range of interest for these numbers in an industrial context, let's consider the example of a vegetable oil/water system.
In most liquid-liquid system encountered in industrial processes the diameter of the droplets lies in the range $d = [50 \mu \text{m}, 3 \text{mm}]$.
The density and viscosity of water are approximately $\rho_f = 1000 \text{kg/m}^3$ and $\mu_f = 10^{-3} \text{Pa.s}$, respectively.
The density and viscosity of oil are close to $\rho_d = 900 \text{kg/m}^3$ and $\mu_d = 10^{-2} \text{Pa.s}$, respectively.
We consider the gravitational acceleration on earth, thus $g= 9.81 \text{m.s}^{-2}$.
The surface tension of the oil/water system is approximately $\sigma = 0.05 \text{N/m}^2$ \citep{de2015gouttes}.

    \label{tab:parameters_exp}
\end{table}
In \ref{tab:parameters_exp} we can observe the values of the corresponding dimensionless parameters.  
Notice that the \textit{Bond number} is relatively low, indicating that the droplets are nearly spherical in these processes.
Additionally, the maximum volume fraction is set to $\phi = 0.2$, indeed above such $\phi$ particles highly coalesce and the topology of the flow cannot be considered as dispersed anymore. 


According to \ref{tab:parameters_exp}, to approach real life applications we conducted DNS for four volume fractions, specifically $\phi = 0.01,0.05,0.1,0.2$.
In contrast to most of the previous studies, we choose to keep the number of droplets constant while changing the volume fraction $\phi$. 
Instead, we modify the domain size $\mathcal{L}$ accordingly. 
This introduces another dimensionless parameter of interest : $\mathcal{L}/d$, which is the confinement of the particles within the finite numerical domain. 
This parameter is purely determined by $\phi$ and $N_b$, therefore it will be refereed as a \textit{Secondary parameter}.

As mentioned, the \textit{Bond} numbers of our targeted application is extremely low.
% This threshold value has been fixed empirically at $Bo = 0.2$, below which we observed no modification in the drop dynamic. 
Therefore, and it will stay constant throughout this study, the \textit{Bond} number is set to $Bo = 0.2$.
DNS with lower \textit{Bond} number could not be archived due to the restrictive capillary time step constrain, which becomes excessively small. 
However, we assert that for $Bo \leq 0.2$ the droplet shape essentially remains spherical at least for small \textit{Galileo} numbers. 
Additionally, the ratio between inertia and surface tension forces is given by the \textit{Weber} number, this is,
\begin{equation*}
    We = \frac{Bo \cdot Re^2}{Ga},
\end{equation*}
where $Re = \frac{\rho_f d U}{\mu_f}$ is the Reynolds number based on the phase drift velocity $U$.
Values of \textit{Reynolds} numbers for each DNS are provided in \ref{ap:age} \ref{fig:Reall}. 
Extreme values of $We$ reached in these simulations are displayed in \ref{tab:simulations}. 
It is clear that for at $We=0.6$ we might expect some deformation, nevertheless, for most of the cases $We$ stays below that values. 
Consequently, whether it is in the viscous regime or inertial regime, the droplets are expected to remain spherical according to the values of $Bo$ and $We$.
This statement will be verified in \ref{sec:microstructure}. 

Density and viscosity ratio of droplets in real life applications are reported in \citet[Figure 1.]{balla2020effect}.
As depicted in \citet[Figure 1.]{balla2020effect}, the viscosity and density ratio of fluid-fluid systems range between, $\lambda \in [10^{-4} : 10^4]$ and $\zeta \in [10^{-1} : 10^1]$, respectively. 
In this study we restrict our attention to a single density ratio, $\zeta = 0.9$.
Regarding the viscosity ratio, we accomplished DNS for 2 different values, namely $\lambda = 1,10$.
Lastly, to explore the effect of inertia on the microstructure, the \textit{Galileo} number will vary within the range $Ga \in [5,100]$.

The primary objective of the study is to investigate the microstructure through the nearest particle pair distribution function.
Thus, it is crucial to obtain a sufficient number of DNS samples to ensure representativeness. 
Also, the physical quantities measured in these DNS must remain independent of the domain size. 
Therefore, we use a number of particles per domain of $N_b = 125$, which is roughly what \citet{hidman2023assessing} used for DNS of fully periodic buoyant rising bubbles.
Moreover, each DNS lasts for a time : $t^*_\text{end} = 1500 \sqrt{d/g}$.
% It is shown in \ref{ap:validation} that these parameters  are sufficient to obtain well converged statistics.

\end{table}
In this study we present DNS results with dimensionless parameters lying in ranges outlined \ref{tab:simulations}.
In summary, we investigated $5$ \textit{Galileo} number $Ga = 5,10,25,50,100$, $4$ different volume fractions $\phi = 0.01,0.05,0.1,0.2$, and two viscosity ratios $\lambda =1,10$ with $Bo = 0.2$ and $\zeta = 0.9$. 
This makes a total of $40$ representative simulations of $N_b = 125$ droplets which last for $t= 1500 \sqrt{d/g}$.
