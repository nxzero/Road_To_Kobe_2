Buoyancy-driven droplet flows are encountered in many chemical engineering processes such as gravity separators and liquid-liquid extractors. 
The usual engineering practice to model such facilities is to use the averaged Navier-Stokes equations and Population Balance Equations (PBE) \citep{castellano2019}. % \paragraph*{Why microstructure is interesting :}
These methods require closure laws and a deep understanding of particle pair statistics \citep{simonin1996}.
These closures laws are strongly dependent on the physical properties of the fluids and on the particle arrangements, which is called in this context the microstructure. 
For example, in the Stokes flow regime for a dilute ordered array consisting of a periodic arrangement of spherical inclusions the dimensionless velocity of the suspension experiences a decrease proportional to the cube root of the volume fraction. 
Conversely, in the case of a random array of freely moving particles, the dimensionless velocities decrease linearly with the volume fraction \citep{saffman1973}.
%Specifically for a dilute ordered array consisting of a periodic arrangement of spherical inclusions the dimensionless velocity of the suspension decreases with the volcume fraction with a power 1/3 of the volume fraction. in contrast for a random array of freely moving particle the dimensionless velocitys decreases linearly with the volume fraction.
For inertial regimes, an example is given in \citet{yin2008lattice}, where they demonstrate that the mean rise velocity of buoyant mono-disperse bubbly flows can be expressed as a power-law of $(1-\phi)$ (where $\phi$ is the particle volume fraction) for random arrangements of particles.
In contrast, for anisotropic arrangements of particles, this power-law relation is a poor fit to the observation, as also exemplified in \citet{loisy2017}.  
Consequently, the mean drag force or mean drift velocity of suspensions, which are crucial closures in two-phase flow problems, depend on the microstructure geometry.  
Another pertinent example involves poly-disperse flows in our industrial contexts. 
Here, PBE come into play for modeling droplet size distributions \citep{randolph2012theory}. 
PBE rely on a coalescence kernel, acting as a source term delineating droplet coalescence rates. 
This kernel varies with the microstructure and the relative kinematics of particle pairs \citep{chesters1991modelling}.
Hence, statistical data on particle pairs become crucial in averaged models. 
The purpose of the present study is thus to characterize the microstructure of an emulsion and the relative kinematics of particle pairs across a broad spectrum of dimensionless parameters. %This endeavor seeks to enhance the accuracy of averaged two-phase flow equations and, more broadly, to deepen our understanding of droplet flows.

%A second example, which is relevant for our industrial applications, is the one of poly-disperse flows.
%In this case we might use Population Balance Equations (PBE)  to model droplets' size distribution \citep{randolph2012theory}. PBE relies on the coalescence kernel, which act as a source term describing the rate of coalescence of droplets. This kernel is microstructure dependent, and also depends on the relative kinematic between particles pairs \citep{chesters1991modelling}. 
%Consequently, pair particles statistics which describe the relative particles' kinematic as well as the microstructure geometry are of utmost importance in the averaged models. 
%Therefore, in this study we propose to characterize the microstructure of an emulsion as well as the relative particles pairs kinematic over a wide range of dimensionless parameters in the perspective of building more accurate models for averaged two phases flows equations and more generally for a better understanding of droplets flows.

% \paragraph*{Biblio physics :}
%Computational methods have become increasingly valuable tools for investigating particle interactions and spatial distributions. 

One of the pioneering study dedicated to the microstructure of bubbly flows via Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) was undertaken by \citet{bunner2002dynamics}. 
They conducted tri-periodic simulations focusing on the behavior of nearly spherical rising bubbles in the regime of moderate inertia, characterized by a bubble Reynolds number of approximately 15. 
In their investigation involving around 30 bubbles within a tri-periodic domain, they noted a tendency for the bubbles to align horizontally in pairs, along with the identification of horizontal arrays of particles. 
An illustration depicting such a microstructure is provided in \ref{fig:scheme_clusters} (Case 4). 
Numerous other studies have investigated the microstructures of bubbly flows using DNS, including those by \citet{yin2008lattice,roghair2011drag,zhang2023evolution, shajahan2023inertial} investigated the sedimentation of solid spherical particles for much larger Reynolds numbers.
In the dilute regime, they observed vertical rafts of particles, and as the particle volume fraction increased, side-by-side particle formations started to appear. 
From an experimental perspective, \citet{almeras2021statistics} examined the microstructure of solid spherical particles within fluidized beds.
They observed the presence of horizontal rafts of particles when the particle volume fraction approached $\phi = 0.14$.
The aforementioned studies solely focused on spherical particles.
It is also known that the deformability of bubbles or more generally, the shapes of the particles greatly influence the microstructure geometry \citet{bunner2003effect,seyed2021sedimentation}. 
In the present study we concentrate our attention on emulsions of nearly-spherical droplets. 

All these studies reported formation of particles structures which are dependent on the dimensionless parameters of the problem. 
These structures can be classified into three classes : The homogeneous microstructure (\ref{fig:scheme_clusters} (\textit{Case 1: ``Homogeneous''})); the non-homogeneous but isotropic microstructure \ref{fig:scheme_clusters} (\textit{Case 2: ``Clusters'' }); and the non-homogeneous and non-isotropic microstructure \ref{fig:scheme_clusters} (\textit{Case 3: ``layers''}). 
Despite these studies, investigation into the microstructure of emulsions remains limited, and in general there is a notable absence of closure models for emulsions in the literature.  
However, understanding the microstructure and the physics of emulsions is crucial for the modeling closure terms which in turns allows us to model industrial processes. 

In practice, the microstructures exhibit a varied range of geometries, ranging from more dispersed to more clustered or layered arrangements. 
Consequently, having a suitable metric to quantify the microstructure becomes essential. 
While some previous studies have used the classical particle-pair distributions for this purpose \citep{yin2007,seyed2021sedimentation}, it is worth noting that this approach has limitations, particularly in modeling, due to its non-vanishing value at large inter-particle distance. 
Hence, in our study, we adopt the methodology proposed by \citet{zhang2023evolution} and characterize the microstructure using a single second-order tensor quantity. 
This tensor represents the second moment of the nearest particle pair distribution and provides a quantitative description of the microstructure.

If one wishes to build relevant statistics, one needs to conduct simulations of droplet flows for a sufficient amount of time to reach a statistically-steady-state regime. 
However, depending on the numerical method used, one may encounter difficulties in preventing coalescence between droplets which is necessary to reach a steady state regime. 
Indeed, the Volume-of-Fluid (VoF) method, which is the method used in this work, is known to cause premature coalescence between droplets or bubbles \citep{innocenti2020direct}.
Several methods have been proposed to address this issue, including those by \citet{roghair2011drag,balcazar2015multiple,hidman2023assessing,zhang2023evolution}, and \citet{karnakov2022computing}. 
The methods used in these studies are either based on front-tracking or by using one volume-of-fluid tracer per droplet, or add a numerical interfacial force to prevent coalescence. 
As will be discussed in the body of the text none of these methods are ideal for our purpose, either because they may lead to non-physical behavior or because they are computationally expensive. 
We therefore propose a new algorithm to prevent coalescence which enables us to perform DNS for arbitrarily long times with a fixed population of droplets within a VoF framework.

In this work, we conduct tri-periodic DNS of mono-disperse buoyancy-driven suspensions of drops. 
We begin in \ref{sec:methodo} by outlining the simulations' methodology, and describe our new algorithm to prevent numerical coalescence between droplets. 
We then briefly introduce the \textit{Nearest Particle Statistics} framework of \citet{zhang2023evolution}. 
In \ref{sec:microstructure}, we delve into an analysis of the microstructure geometry and identify the structures depicted in \ref{fig:scheme_clusters} and their correlations with the dimensionless parameters of the problem.
