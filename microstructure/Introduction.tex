\section{Introduction}


Buoyancy-driven droplet flows are encountered in many chemical engineering processes such as gravity separators, liquid-liquid extractors, etc. The usual engineering practice to model such facilities is to make use of the averaged Navier-Stokes equations and population balance equations. 
However, these methods necessitate closure laws and a deep understanding of particle pair statistics.
Therefore, within a multiscale strategy, we perform tri-periodic Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of monodisperse buoyancy driven suspension of drops.
In addition to providing data for the closure terms appearing in averaged models, the simulations are of great interest to understand and describe the microstructure of suspensions. 
In this work we present a concise analysis of the microstructure by analyzing the \textit{Nearest Particle Statistics} recently revisited by \citet{zhang2021ensemble}



\ldots

Therefore, in this work we investigate the microsture and interaction kinematic of a buoyant rising emulsion.
