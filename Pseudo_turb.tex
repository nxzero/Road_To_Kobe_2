\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    % We performed direct numerical simulation (DNS) of mono disperse rising droplets. 
    This article present a numerical analysis of the pseudo turbulence Reynolds stress and interphase drag force in inertial emulsion. 
    In the view of feeding averaged navier stokes model it is crucial to obtain those terms. 
    In this work new kind of algorithm which prevent coalescence between VOF tracer has been developed.
    This enables us to perform statistically steady state simulations of mono-disperse buoyant droplets for various \textit{Galileo} number $Ga = 5 \rightarrow 10$, volume fraction $\phi =1\% \rightarrow 10\%$ and viscosity ratio $\lambda = 0.1,1$. 
    By the mean of the recent concept of the nearest particle statistics \citep{zhang2021stress} we analyze meticulously the averaged flow flied around a particle and the averaged particles relative position.s 
    From this analysis we propose physical interpretation to explain the form of the closure terms.
    In this study we focus on the interphase drag and velocity fluctuation.

\subsection{Statistics computations}

Objectives : 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Present How we compute the particle properties. 
    \item Explain How we approximate the ensemble average in the numerical calculations
    \item Focus on the drag force term and on the velocity fluctuation. 
\end{itemize}

Following \citet{du2022analysis} we consider ergodicity at all time of the numerical experiment.
Thus, the ensemble average of a quantity $X$ can be approximated by a spatial average $\Xavg{X}$ and a time average $\Tavg{X}$ such that $\int X d\PP = \avg{X} \approx \Xavg{\Tavg{X}} = \Tavg{\Xavg{X}}$.
Consequently, the ensemble average of a numerical field, $X$, is taken through space and time such that,
\begin{equation}
    \avg{X}
    = \Tavg{\Xavg{X}}
    = \frac{1}{ t_{end} - t_0}\int_{t_0}^{t_{end}} 
    \Xavg{X}(t) dt
\end{equation}
where, 
\begin{equation}
    \Xavg{X}(t)
    = \frac{1}{L^3}\int 
    X(\textbf{x},t) d\textbf{x}
\end{equation}
where $L$ is the length of the cubic domain.
$t_0$ and $t_{end}$ is the starting time of sampling and the time duration of the simulation, respectively.
In practice, we take $t_0$ such that the simulation reach a statistically steady regime for $t>t_0$.  
Both $t_{end} $ and $t_0$ are given in \ref{ap:A} after several validations studies. 

To compute the continuous phase averaged quantities such as \ref{eq:def_uuc} we proceed as such,
\begin{equation}
    \phi_c \bm{\sigma}^{\text{Re}}_c /\rho_c
    % = \Tavg{\Xavg{\chi_c \textbf{u}_c' \textbf{u}_c'}}
    = \Tavg{\Xavg{\chi_c (\textbf{u}_c^0 -\textbf{u}_c ) (\textbf{u}_c^0 -\textbf{u}_c)}}
    = \Tavg{\Xavg{\chi_c \textbf{u}_c^0 \textbf{u}_c^0}}
    -  \phi_c  \textbf{u}_c \textbf{u}_c.
    \label{eq:def_uuc_num} 
\end{equation}
where the indicator funciton $\chi_c$ must be understood as its approximation in the DNS, i.e the color function $1 - \alpha_d$. 
Consequently, \ref{eq:def_uuc_num} indicate that we must take the average of the product of the velocities, and then we retrieve the mean velocities' product. 
Additionally,  note that the Reynolds stress can be decomposed by such as : 
\begin{align*}
    \phi_c \bm{\sigma}^{\text{Re}}_c /\rho_c
    &= 
    \Tavg{\Xavg{\chi_c (\textbf{u}_c^0 -\Xavg{\chi_c\textbf{u}_c^0} / \Xavg{\chi_c} ) (\textbf{u}_c^0 -\Xavg{\chi_c\textbf{u}_c^0} / \Xavg{\chi_c} )}}\\
    &+ \Tavg{\Xavg{\chi_c} (\Xavg{\chi_c\textbf{u}_c^0} / \Xavg{\chi_c} - \textbf{u}_c ) (\Xavg{\chi_c\textbf{u}_c^0} / \Xavg{\chi_c} - \textbf{u}_c)}\\
\end{align*}
where the first term is the space fluctuation relative to the instantaneous mean velocity of the fluid $\Xavg{\chi_c\textbf{u}_c^0} / \Xavg{\chi_c}$, and the second is the time fluctuation of the instantaneous mean velocity of the fluid. 

Similar expression can be derived for the particular phase by integrating the property over the volume of the particle which is done throught the use of the \texttt{tag.h} function, then we average on each particle at all time.

\subsection{Shape of the particles}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Problematic : "What is teh mean shape of our particles ? "
    \item Present the definition of the aspect ratio.
    \item Show how it behaves in terms of $\phi,\lambda$ and $Ga$
    \item Overall, show that the particles are rather spherical which were also demonstrated by the previous plots regarding the flow lines. 
    \item Besides the deformation increase with increasing $Ga$ and small $\phi$ which agree with \citet{loisy2017buoyancy}. 
\end{itemize}


It is known since \todo{biblio} \citet{bunner2003effect} that droplets or bubbles mean rising velocity is mainly dependent on their shapes. 
For spherical bubbles it was observed that the rising velocity $Re$ were proportional to $\sim Re_{\phi=0}(1 - \phi^{1/3})$, where $Re_{\phi=0}$ is the isolated rising Reynolds number. 
Whereas deformable bubbles a $\sim Re_{\phi=0}(1 - \phi)^{3}$ dependency is observed \todo{biblio}. 
This is n=in fact due to the different arrangement taken by the particles as a consequence of their deformations. 
Therefore, in order to develop a coherent model we first investigate the droplets mean shapes. 
After what we present the dependency of the rising velocity and drag force with the main parameters of the problems.

\todo{compart with bubbly flow especially with \citet{loisy2017buoyancy} and show that it is way weaker deformation for bubbles }
\todo{also with \citet{dandy1989buoyancy}}
\ref{fig:chi} display the averaged aspect ratio of the droplets.
It is defined using the conventional manner \citep{bunner2003effect}, namely,
\begin{equation}
    \chi = \pavg{\sqrt{\mathcal{I}_{max}^\alpha /\mathcal{I}_{min}^\alpha} }
\end{equation} 
where, $\mathcal{I}_{max}^\alpha$ and $\mathcal{I}_{min}^\alpha$ are the maximum and minimum eigenvalues value of the particle inertia tensor, which is defined as, 
\begin{equation*}
    \mathcal{I}^\alpha
    = \int_{V_\alpha} \left[
        (\textbf{r}\cdot \textbf{r}) \textbf{I}  - \textbf{rr}
        \right]
    dV.
\end{equation*}
where, \textbf{I} is the identity tensor and $\textbf{r} = \textbf{x} - \textbf{x}_\alpha$. 
From the plots \ref{fig:chi} we clearly see that the droplets flatten with increasing \textit{Galileo} numbers and decreasing drop volume fraction. 
Also, it seems that for low viscosity ratio the aspect ratio of the droplets is lower. 
At small $Ga$ the averaged aspect ratio $\chi$ tends to $1$, implying that in this regime droplets are mainly spherical. 

Overall we reach a maximum of $\chi = 1.1$ which implies a deviation from a spherical shape of $10 \%$. 

\tb{If we defined $\chi = \avg{s_\alpha} / \avg{v_\alpha}  a/3$ where $s_\alpha$  is the surface $v_\alpha$ the volume and $a$ the radius of the particles we would obtain approximately the same plots}
