\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    We performed direct numerical simulation (DNS) of mono disperse rising droplets. 
    This article present a numerical analysis of the pseudo turbulence Reynolds stress and interphase drag force in water / oil emulsion. 
    Indeed, in the view of feeding averaged model it is crucial to obtain course terms. 
    Until now, it wasn't possible due to the non statistically steadiness of VOF simulations because of the numerical coalescence. 
    In this work we make use of a new kind of algorithm to prevent coalescence to happen. 
    Therefor we are able to reach a statistically steady simulation and to compute the averaged closure terms.

\section{Space convergence}


Now, let's investigate the required number of droplets per domain, $N_b$, and the minimum definition of cells per diameter of droplets $\delta$.  
\tb{Include bibliography and expectation here \ldots}
For this investigation we kept the physical parameters presented in the same section and made a double parametric analysis over $N$ and $\delta$. 
We carried out simulations for $N = 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7$, and for a number of cells $10 <\delta < 40$. 
In Basilisk the mesh definition is defined by a power of two, consequently depending on the size of the domain (which is fixed to keep a $\phi$ constant) the $\delta$ parameter is fixed at a power of 2 close.

    \caption{(left) Averaged relative velocities for both phases.

            The text on the side of the points is $\delta$. }
    \label{fig:VALIDATION_Nd_1}
\end{figure}
\ref{fig:VALIDATION_Nd_1}(left), illustrate clearly that the drift velocity is independent of the parameters $N_b$ and $\delta$, for $N >4$. 
On the other hand, \ref{fig:VALIDATION_Nd_1}(right), show that the volume fraction of the dispersed phase is lower for the low defined grid (red dots), due to a loss of volume during the simulation.
This doesn't mean that the solver isn't volume conservative. 
In fact, it is fund to be due to the \href{http://basilisk.fr/sandbox/fintzin/Rising-Suspension/no-coalescence.h}{no-coalescence.h} which generate fragment into the numerical domain, fragment which are deleted in the long run.

            (right) Particular average of the first moment tensor, where $F_g$ is the buoyancy force applied on one droplet. 
            The numerical values displayed alongside the dots are the number of cells per diameter.}
    \label{fig:VALIDATION_Nd_2}
\end{figure}
Now, let's look at the behavior of more \textit{complicated} closure terms. 
\ref{fig:VALIDATION_Nd_2}(left) demonstrate that the vertical component of the pseudo turbulent tensor is parameter independent rather early, independently of the grid definition. 
This fact is rather surprising but notice that the standard deviation is quite high for small domain. 
On \ref{fig:VALIDATION_Nd_2}(right), we can examine the vertical component of the first moment closure term. 
It is found to be constant for all $N$, but rather inaccurate for coarse grids. 
Which makes sens since the first moment results from a local calculation of the stress over a droplet volume, unlike the other quantities which results from the averaged center of mass velocity of a droplet. 

As we have shown, the quantities presented converge for a number of droplets equivalent to $N = 4$ and $\delta = 25$. 
Thus, we validate our simulation in space, i.e. we made sure that our domain were wide enough to minimize the influence of the periodicity on our results, and in mesh definition. 
Nevertheless, at it is the number of realization that matter when carrying a particular average, it is interesting to look at the duration of the simulation.
