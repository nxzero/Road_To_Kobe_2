\begin{abstract}
    In this brief study, we propose a new model for the interphase drag force term to be used in the averaged Navier-Stokes equations. 
    This model is restricted to homogeneous and steady-state, mono-disperse multiphase flows. 
    Drawing upon previous numerical and experimental studies in the literature, we develop a drag force model that accounts for arbitrary viscosity ratios between the dispersed and continuous phase, noted $\lambda$. 
    Most prior models have focused on sedimentation involving solid particles or buoyant rising bubbles. 
    Following \citet{rivkind1976flow}, we interpolate between these two class of models to create a robust formulation that remains valid for intermediate values of $\lambda$, across all Reynolds numbers $Re$ and volume fractions $\phi$.
    Specifically, we employ the models of \citet{schiller1933} and \citet{mei1994} to describe the drag force on solid sphere and spherical bubbles, respectively.
    Then we incorporate a Richardson-Zaki law made for solid particles to account for the volume fraction ($\phi$), at arbitrary \textit{Reynolds} numbers ($Re$) \citep{kramer2019improvement}.
    To account for the variable $\lambda$, we adjust the Richardson-Zaki exponent based on experimental observations in the Stokes regime \citep{ishii1979drag}. 
    The \texttt{no-coalesence.h} algorithm presented in our last study enables us to perform statistically steady-state simulations of mono-disperse buoyant droplets for various \textit{Galileo} number $Ga = 5 \rightarrow 10$, volume fraction $\phi =1\% \rightarrow 20\%$ and viscosity ratio $\lambda = 0.1,1,10$. 
    From these DNS simulations, we could measure the drag coefficient and compare it to the semi-empirical prediction developed in this study. 
    By comparing our literature-based model with DNS results, we successfully validate this new drag force coefficient in the intermediate $\lambda$ regime.
