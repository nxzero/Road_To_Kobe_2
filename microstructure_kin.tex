\begin{abstract}
    In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the timescale that govern the droplets' interaction as well as the global microstructure in buoyant emulsions. 
    It is shown  in \citep{fintzi2024buoyancy} that as predicted by \citet{zhang2023evolution}, the second moment of the nearest particle pair distribution, noted \textbf{R}, has the capability to quantify microstructure's features such as clusters and layers of particles.
    In this study we propose to analyze the microstructure kinematic through the derivation of a transport equation for \textbf{R} within the framework of kinematic theory. 
    We conducted Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of statistically steady state mono-disperse buoyant emulsion, over a broad range of \textit{Galileo} number ($Ga$), particle volume fraction ($\phi$), and viscosity ratio ($\lambda$). 
    The density ratio and the \textit{Bond} number are kept constant, $\zeta = 1.11$ and  $Bo = 0.2$, respectively. 
    By a rigorous theoretical and numerical analysis we could show that :
    (1) the time of relaxation of $\textbf{R}(\textbf{x},t)$, is the mean age of interaction of the  nearest particles pairs $\tau_p(\textbf{x},t)$;
    (2) The particle normal approach velocity scale as $\tau_p n_p^{1/3}$ with $n_p$ the number density, and has also a relaxation time of $\tau_p$.
    (3) We could evaluate the different source terms in the transport equation for $\textbf{R}$ in terms of the dimensionless parameters. 
    Overall the mean time of interaction $\tau_p$ seem to be a crucial quantity in the modeling of the particle relative kinematic of dispersed two phase flows.
