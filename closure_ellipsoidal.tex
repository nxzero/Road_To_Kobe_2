\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
    In this work we propose to derive an averaged set of equations for deformable droplets. 
    It is assumed that the droplets shape remains ellipsoidal. 
    Specifically, we derive the classical momentum and mass balance under a Lagrangian-based formulation. 
    Then we demonstrate how to derive \textit{shape} and orientation equations based on the \textit{moment of momentum} and second moment of mass of the particle. 
    This model constitutes the first results of the paper. 
    As an application we propose to evaluate theoretically the contribution to the stress from uniformly translating spheroidal particles. 
    It is demonstrated that due to the effect of small inertia, the \textit{stresslet} term present in the effective stress has a contribution proportional to the mean relative velocity of the dispersed phase. 
    This could be of major importance for rising bubbly flows.

\label{sec:averaged_eq}
\tb{expose the avg equaiton under the form of the particles phase exposed above }
\tb{ Maybe do the local reference frame avg eq }
\tb{ Explain that these need closure and that the kinetic internal eq can be used for the shape as well }
\tb{ Then the form of some closure is derived in appendix }
