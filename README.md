##  Averaged equations for disperse two-phase flow made of fluid particles
* Re demonstrate the Taylor expansion formula with the method of Pathz
* Re-do the example section. It must be about momentum equation and the usual closure terms in Newtonian viscosity term. It has never been done for arbitrary particles + the stress equation is actually interesting. 
  * Include fist mass conservation equations  :
    * $\left<\phi_k\right>$ equations     --->KNOWN
    * $\left<\delta_I\right>$ equation     --->KNOWN
    * $m_\alpha$ equation  --->KNOWN
    * $s_\alpha$ equation --->KNOWN
    * $M_\alpha$ equation --->not usually used 
      * talk about how we recover the fiber equations and the PBE equations ? 
  * Include the momentum conservation :
    * $D\left<\rho_k \textbf{u}_k\right>/Dt$ --->KNOWN but not with all the stresses 
      * Reformualte the drag force term properly with the pressure gradient and the binary force. 
      * inter particle interactions (lok zhang 2023 for sigma_c)
      * Newtonnian stress (with fluid particle)
      * Discuss PFP, 
      * fluid fluctuation
      * first moment of fluid traction. 
      * How the stress tensor is or isn't symmetric ? Prosperreti (2004) 
    * $D \overline{m_\alpha \textbf{u}_\alpha}^p/Dt$ --->not KNOWN for arbitrary fluid particle of different size with all the stresses 
      * How the stress is expressed there (same but without the averaged newtonnian stress)
    * $D \overline{P_\alpha}/Dt$ --> not knwon in this many details and tension surface. 
      1. Discus the torque equation with inter particular torque 
         * Decompose the torque with Nearest-particle statistics ? (limited interest)
      2. Make the trace equation 
      3. Discus the stress equation and say it is relevent for solid particle and make the link with einstein equaivalent viscosity and the new paper of wolgemuth 2023.
        * give the good formulation of teh first moment with surface tension. 

A FAIRE 
We consider only interaction through the fluid meaning that the "contact stress doesn't exist. Indeed the microscopic model assume no particles contact. 

Or we consider all the forces merged into $h^h$ enabling us to compute the $\Sigma_{PFP}$ + $\Sigma_c$

## Statistics (look at Zhang 2023 not to bad)

1. Introduction :
   * In the objective of creating a clear coalescence kernel it is important to discuss the actual physics of interaction 
   * To do so we use nearest averaged statistics. 

2. Theoretical background 


4. Conclusion :
   1.  We clarify what exactly happen between pairs of particles in an emulsion
