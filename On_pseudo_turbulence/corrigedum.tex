To derive an analytical formula for the Reynolds stress we have considered in \ref{chap:pseudoturbulence} the formula,
\begin{equation}
    \avg{\chi_f \textbf{u}_f'\textbf{u}_f'}
    = 
    \phi_f
    \int_{\mathbb{R}^6}
    \textbf{v}_f^\text{nst}
    \textbf{v}_f^\text{nst}
    P_\text{nst}^f
    d\textbf{y}
    d\textbf{w}
    + 
    \int_{\mathbb{R}^6}
    \avg{
        \chi_f
        \textbf{u}_f''
        \textbf{u}_f''
        % \sum_i 
        % \delta(\textbf{x}+\textbf{y}-\textbf{x}_i)
        % \delta(\textbf{w}-\textbf{u}_i)
        % h_i
        \delta_\text{nst}
    }
    d\textbf{y}
    d\textbf{w}.
\end{equation}
We could compute the first term on the right-hand side of this expression, we claimed that the second term were negligible. 
The derivation carried for the first term is rigorous. 

Nevertheless, the fact that we neglected the second term was erroneous, in fact the second term of this expression may be reformulated as such, 
\begin{multline*}
    \int \avg{\delta_i h_i \chi_f \textbf{v}_f''\textbf{v}_f''}  d\textbf{r}
    = 
    \underbrace{\int 
    \textbf{v}^{(\text{2-nst})}_f
    \textbf{v}^{(\text{2-nst})}_f 
    P_\text{2-nst}
    d\textbf{r}^2}_{\sim \phi^{2/3}}
    +  
    \underbrace{\int 
    \textbf{v}^{(\text{3-nst})}_f
    \textbf{v}^{(\text{3-nst})}_f 
    P_\text{3-nst}
    d\textbf{r}^3}_{\phi^{2/3}}
    \\
    +\ldots\underbrace{\int 
    \textbf{v}^{(\text{N-nst})}_f
    \textbf{v}^{(\text{N-nst})}_f 
    P_\text{N}
    d\textbf{r}^N}_{  \sim \phi^{2/3}}. 
\end{multline*}
Each term corresponds to the contribution of the averaged wake induced by the second, third, and $N^{\text{th}}$ droplets.
Ultimately, if one considers all the $N^{\text{th}}$ droplets in the flow, what we have done is merely to reorder the terms in the divergence series of \citet{caflisch1985variance}, thereby not resolving the so-called ``divergence paradox''.

Nevertheless, retaining only the contribution from the nearest particle remains valuable, as it yields a reasonably accurate model for dilute configurations (see \ref{chap:pseudoturbulence}).
Therefore, we argue that although the calculation is incomplete, it still holds practical relevance from an engineering perspective.
