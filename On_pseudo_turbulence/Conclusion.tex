\section{Conclusion}

Based on solid theoritical ground we providede a nice formula for the Reynolds stress. 



Nevertheless we have seen that the Reynolds stress of teh fluid phase is an explicite funciton of the particl ephase elocity fluctuation. 
In order to obtain a complete algebrical model we need therefore to model the tensor $\pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha'\textbf{u}_\alpha'}$. 
This is the subject of the follwoing studies.
