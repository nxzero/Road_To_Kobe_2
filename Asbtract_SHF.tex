Buoyancy-driven droplet flows are encountered in many chemical engineering processes such as gravity separators and liquid-liquid extractors. 
The usual engineering practice to model such facilities is to use the averaged Navier-Stokes equations. 
These equations require closure laws \citep{jackson1997locally}. 
The present work focus on the velocity fluctuations tensor, also called the \textit{Reynolds stress} tensor. 

Let, $\avg{\ldots}$ denote an ensemble average operator, $\textbf{u}_f^0$ the local fluid velocity and $\chi_f$ the continuous phase indicator function.
Then, $\textbf{u}_f' = \textbf{u}_f^0 - \textbf{u}_f$ is the velocity fluctuation with $\textbf{u}_f =\avg{\chi_f \textbf{u}_f^0} / \phi_f$ the mean continuous phase velocity and $\phi_f = \avg{\chi_f}$ the continuous phase volume fraction. 
With these definitions the \textit{Reynolds stress} tensor of the continuous phase might be written : $\avg{\chi_f \textbf{u}_f' \textbf{u}_f'}$.

This tensor can be decomposed into two contributions : (1) the agitation generated due to the averaged wakes around the particles; (2) all other source of fluctuations such as those generated through particles interactions and the single phase turbulence. 
Formally this is written, 
\begin{equation}
    \avg{\chi_k \textbf{u}'_f\textbf{u}'_f}(\textbf{x})
    = 
    \underbrace{\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\textbf{u}_f^1\textbf{u}_f^1 P_{f}^1(\textbf{x},\textbf{r}) d\textbf{r} }_\text{(1)}
    \\+\underbrace{\int_{\mathbb{R}^3} \textbf{R} P_{f}^1(\textbf{x},\textbf{r}) d\textbf{r}}_\text{(2)}
    - \phi_f \textbf{u}_f\textbf{u}_f,
    \label{eq1}
\end{equation}
where $P_f^1(\textbf{x},\textbf{r})$ is the probability of finding the fluid phase at \textbf{x} while having a particle center of mass at $\textbf{r}$. 
Additionally, $\textbf{u}_f^1(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)$ is the averaged fluid phase velocity conditionally on the presence of a particle center of mass at $\textbf{r}$.
In this sense the first term on the right-hand side is the contribution from the averaged wakes. 
The last term is the contribution from the velocity fluctuation around the conditional velocity $\textbf{u}_f^1$ which is omitted in this study. 

To determine the  $\textbf{u}_f^1(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)$ at first order in dispersed phase volume fraction $\phi_d$ one has to solve the conditionally averaged Navier Stokes equation at zero-order volume fraction \cite{hinch1977averaged}.
Therefore, $\textbf{u}_f^1$ can be substituted by the disturbance velocity field of an isolated particle to determine the pseudoturbulence at order zero in volume fraction.
It is in this context that \cite{van1998pseudo} derived a theoritical model for the \textit{Reynolds stress} considering isolated translating bubbles in potential flows, it reads, 
\begin{equation}
    \avg{\chi_k \textbf{u}'_f\textbf{u}'_f}(\textbf{x})
    = \phi \left(\frac{3}{20} U^2\textbf{I} + \frac{1}{20} \textbf{UU} \right)
\end{equation}
where $\textbf{U} = \textbf{u}_d - \textbf{u}_f$ is the drift velocity. 
The integral of \ref{eq1} converged in the case of potential flows since the disturbance velocity field of a translating spherical bubble in potential flow is $\sim \mathcal{O}(r^{-3})$ where $r$ is the distance to the particle center of mass.  
In stokes flows it is well known that the disturbance velocity field of a translating bubble or droplet is $\sim \mathcal{O}(r^{-1})$.
This leads to an infinite \textit{Reynolds stress} according to  \ref{eq1}. 

Eventhrough the limit $\lim_{\phi \to 0} =\avg{\chi_f \textbf{u}_f'\textbf{u}_f'}= \infty$ we might be able to determine the tangent of the \textit{Reynolds stress} at infinity. 
Nevertheless, using \textit{Nearest particle statistics} we are able to by-pass this problem a find the form of the asymmetrical tangent at infinity.
