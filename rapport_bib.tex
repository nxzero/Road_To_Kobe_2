\chapter{Averaged equations for disperse two-phase flow with interfacial transport}
\label{chap:daniel1}
\chapabstract{
    This chapter provides a derivation of the averaged equations governing the motion of dispersed two-phase flows with interfacial transport. 
    We begin by revisiting the two-fluid formulation, as well as the distributional form of the interfacial transport equation which holds on the entire domain. 
    Following this, a general Lagrangian model is introduced, which accounts for the effects of both internal and interfacial properties of the dispersed inclusions (bubbles, droplets, or particles) within a continuous phase.
    This is achieved by derivation of conservation laws for particle surface and volume-integrated properties. 
    By summing the internal and interfacial conservation laws, we derive a conservation equation for an arbitrary Lagrangian property associated with the inclusion. 
    % The key advantage of this formulation is that the non-convective flux inside the inclusion does not appear in the conservation law. 
    Notably, the non-convective flux inside the inclusion does not appear in the conservation law using this formulation. 
    %We then proceed to derive the the lesser-known conservation equations for the moments related to an arbitrary Lagrangian property.
    We then proceed by deriving the lesser-known conservation equations for the moments of the volume and surface distribution of an arbitrary Lagrangian property.  
    Next, the averaged equations for the dispersed phase are derived through two distinct approaches: the particle-averaged (or Lagrangian) formalism, and the phase-averaged method. 
    The main conclusion of this work is the demonstration of the equivalence between the particle-averaged and phase-averaged equations. 
    We show that the dispersed phase-averaged equations can be interpreted as a series expansion of the particle-averaged moment equations. 
    The paper concludes by presenting a "hybrid" set of equations, consisting of phase-averaged equations for the continuous fluid phase, complemented by an arbitrary number of moment conservation equations for the dispersed phase.

\chapter{Closure for spherical droplets in stokes flow regime. }
\label{chap:daniel2}
\chapabstract{
In this chapter we first demonstrate how to reformulate any ensemble averaged terms into what we call \textit{single-particle conditional} averaged quantities. 
To obtain these quantities we propose a generic routine to derive the \textit{single-particle conditional averaged} Navier-Stokes equations. 
We show that in the limiting case of low volume fraction we find back the classic equations of isolated particles immersed in an unbounded fluid. 
Additionally, we demonstrate that our method can be extended to more complicated situation, which might leads to the consideration of non-vanishing volume fraction of particles or gradient of concentration for examples.
This interest of this derivation is that it could lead to the derivation of closure terms functions of the gradient of the volume fraction for inhomogeneous flows. 
Unfortunately, even if we could derive the equations for these complicated scenarios they remain insolvable. 
Thus, we derive the closure accurate at $\mathcal{O}(\phi)$ for spherical droplets in stokes flows.
New results are obtained for the moment equations closure but mainly for the energy equation closure.

\chapter{Averaged equations for deformable ellipsoidal fluid particles : Stress in homogeneous buoyant rising deformable bubbles suspension }
\label{chap:deformable}
\chapabstract{
In this work we propose to derive an averaged set of equations for deformable droplets. 
It is assumed that the droplets shape remains ellipsoidal. 
Specifically, we demonstrate how to derive \textit{shape} and orientation equations based on the \textit{moment of momentum} and second moment of mass of the particle. 
This model constitutes the first results of the paper. 
As an application we propose to evaluate theoretically the contribution to the stress from uniformly translating spheroidal particles. 
It is demonstrated that due to the effect of small inertia, the \textit{stresslet} term present in the effective stress of the continuous phase momentum equation, has a contribution proportional to the mean relative velocity of the dispersed phase. 
Therefore, relative translation between phase generate effective stress, regardless of the pseudo turbulence term. 
In addition, using the particle deformation equation we are able to show that the \textit{stresslet} term is at the origin of the droplets' deformation. 
Finally, we give an explicit formula for the droplet deformation based on the particle Stresslet in steady state regime.

\chapter{Microstructure modeling with nearest particle statistics}
\chapabstract{
    In this study, we analyze the various arrangements that droplets can form within dispersed buoyant emulsions, which we refer to as the study of microstructure. 
    We perform Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of statistically steady state mono-disperse buoyant emulsion over a broad range of dimensionless parameters, including the particle volume fraction ($\phi$), the Galileo number ($Ga$) and the viscosity ratio ($\lambda$). 
    We make use of nearest particle statistics to quantify the microstructure properties.  
    As predicted by \citet{zhang2023evolution}, it is demonstrated that the second moment of the nearest particle pair distribution can effectively quantify microstructural features such as particle clusters and layers. 
    Specifically, the findings are: (1) In moderately inertial flows ($Ga=10$), droplets form isotropic clusters. 
    In high inertial regimes ($Ga=100$), non-isotropic clusters, such as horizontal layers, are more likely to form. 
    (3) The viscosity ratio plays a significant role in determining the microstructure, with droplets that are less viscous or equally viscous as the surrounding fluid tending to form layers preferentially. 
    Overall, our study provides a quantitative measure of the microstructure 
     in terms of $Ga$, $\phi$ and $\lambda$.

\chapter{Analysis and modeling of the microstructure kinematic}
\chapabstract{
In this study, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the timescale that govern the droplets' interaction as well as the global microstructure in buoyant emulsions. 
It is shown  in \citep{fintzi2024buoyancy} that as predicted by \citet{zhang2023evolution}, the second moment of the nearest particle pair distribution, noted \textbf{R}, has the capability to quantify microstructure's features such as clusters and layers of particles.
In this study we propose to analyze the microstructure kinematic through the derivation of a transport equation for \textbf{R} within the framework of kinematic theory. 
We conducted Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) of statistically steady state mono-disperse buoyant emulsion, over a broad range of \textit{Galileo} number ($Ga$), particle volume fraction ($\phi$), and viscosity ratio ($\lambda$). 
The density ratio and the \textit{Bond} number are kept constant, $\zeta = 1.11$ and  $Bo = 0.2$, respectively. 
By a rigorous theoretical and numerical analysis we could show that :
(1) the time of relaxation of $\textbf{R}(\textbf{x},t)$, is the mean age of interaction of the  nearest particles pairs $\tau_p(\textbf{x},t)$;
(2) The particle normal approach velocity scale as $\tau_p n_p^{1/3}$ with $n_p$ the number density, and has also a relaxation time of $\tau_p$.
(3) We could evaluate the different source terms in the transport equation for $\textbf{R}$ in terms of the dimensionless parameters. 
Overall the mean time of interaction $\tau_p$ seem to be a crucial quantity in the modeling of the particle relative kinematic of dispersed two phase flows.

\chapter{Yet another drag force correlation}
\label{chap:mono-disperse}
\chapabstract{    
    In this brief study, we propose a new model for the interphase drag force term to be used in the averaged Navier-Stokes equations. 
    This model is restricted to homogeneous and steady-state, mono-disperse multiphase flows. 
    Drawing upon previous numerical and experimental studies in the literature, we develop a drag force model that accounts for arbitrary viscosity ratios between the dispersed and continuous phase, noted $\lambda$. 
    Most prior models have focused on sedimentation involving solid particles or buoyant rising bubbles. 
    Following \citet{rivkind1976flow}, we interpolate between these two class of models to create a robust formulation that remains valid for intermediate values of $\lambda$, across all Reynolds numbers $Re$ and volume fractions $\phi$.
    Specifically, we employ the models of \citet{schiller1933} and \citet{mei1994} to describe the drag force on solid sphere and spherical bubbles, respectively.
    Then we incorporate a Richardson-Zaki law made for solid particles to account for the volume fraction ($\phi$), at arbitrary \textit{Reynolds} numbers ($Re$) \citep{kramer2019improvement}.
    To account for the variable $\lambda$, we adjust the Richardson-Zaki exponent based on experimental observations in the Stokes regime \citep{ishii1979drag}. 
    The \texttt{no-coalesence.h} algorithm presented in our last study enables us to perform statistically steady-state simulations of mono-disperse buoyant droplets for various \textit{Galileo} number $Ga = 5 \rightarrow 10$, volume fraction $\phi =1\% \rightarrow 20\%$ and viscosity ratio $\lambda = 0.1,1,10$. 
    From these DNS simulations, we could measure the drag coefficient and compare it to the semi-empirical prediction developed in this study. 
    By comparing our literature-based model with DNS results, we successfully validate this new drag force coefficient in the intermediate $\lambda$ regime.

\chapter{Theoretical calculation of the droplet induced agitation (or pseudoturbulence) in mono disperse buoyant emulsions for low inertia and dilute regime.}
\label{chap:pseudoturbulence}
\chapabstract{
    In this study we derive an analytical expression for the continuous phase \textit{Reynolds stress} tensor. 
    This derivation is restricted to the dilute regime where the dispersed phase volume fraction labeled $\phi$ is vanishingly small and for particle Reynolds number $Re \ll 1$. 
    In this context we derive an analytical formula for the pseudoturbulence generated by translating bubbles or droplets inside a Newtonian fluid. 
    To by-pass the integral convergence difficulties generated due to the $\mathcal{O}(r^{-1})$ decay of the disturbance velocity field we make use of the Nearest-Particle-Statistical (NPS) as it is introduced in \citet{zhang2023evolution}.
