\begin{abstract}
    In this note, we use the reciprocal theorem to compute the first moment of hydrodynamic forces applied on a translating spherical droplet immersed in a uniform flow. 
    According to Hadamard-Rybczynski solution \citep{kim2013microhydrodynamics}, the first moment generated by the flow field surrounding a translating spherical droplet in a uniform flow, in the Stokes regime, is identically null. 
    In this study we consider finite but low droplet Reynolds number, $Re$, and compute the first order correction in $Re$ of the first moment of hydrodynamic forces. 
    It is shown that, in dimensionless form, the first moment is proportional to the square of the relative velocity times the Reynolds number.  
    The main consequence of that finding is that in a dilute emulsion of buoyant droplets, the effective stress is also proportional to the relative motion between phases and the Reynolds number. 
    % Particularly, we show that this stress have the form $\sim Re\phi [C_1\textbf{UU}+C_2\textbf{U}\cdot\textbf{U}]$ where $C_1$ and $C_2$ are constant of order one, and $\phi$ is the volume fraction.
