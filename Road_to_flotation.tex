\begin{abstract}
    Based on the averaged equations for dispersed multiphase flows \citep{jackson2000} we derive a criterion for the minimal height $L$ of a cylindrical flotation column (specifically, dissolved air flotation). 
    We start with a brief summary of the results, then we apply the results to a few examples of flotation columns (``CleanWash'', ``Colonne labo Solaize'') determining their ideal size. 
    The details of the theory are given afterward, from the local-scales equations governing the fluid to the macroscopic 3D equation and finally the 1D model.
    A significant discrepancy with existing literature has been identified during the re-derivation of the collision kernel in viscous uniform flows.
    By incorporating the Fax√©n force acting on particles immersed in the wake of bubbles, we demonstrate that conventional formulas commonly used in the literature \citep{loewenberg1994flotation} underestimate the collision efficiency by a factor of  $1/4$.
