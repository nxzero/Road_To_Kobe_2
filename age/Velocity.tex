\subsection{Relative particles kinematic}

In \ref{sec:microstructure} we have investigated the microstructure geometry, 
in \ref{sec:time} we have seen that the timescale governing both, the microstructure evolution and the particles pair relative velocity is $\tau_p$.   
We now give a visual representation of the nearest pair relative velocity in space to better understand how the relative kinematic behave.  
To that end we compute the nearest relative velocity and age, averaged on all ages, that is,
\begin{align*}
    \textbf{w}^\text{r}_pP_r(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)
    =\int_0^\infty \textbf{w}^\text{nst}_pP_\text{nst}(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t,a) da,\\
    a^rP_r(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)
    =\int_0^\infty a P_\text{nst}(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t,a) da.
\end{align*}
The superscript $^\text{r}$ indicate that the quantity $\textbf{w}^\text{r}_p$ and $a^r$ is conditioned on the relative position \textbf{r} only.
As will be demonstrated, having a good estimation of these velocities and ages mean fields allows one to reconstruct the history of the particles' kinematic interactions. 
To be able to visualize
$\textbf{w}^\text{r}_p(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)$
and 
$a^r(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)$
on 2D plots we consider an axis symmetry along the vertical axis, and average the values of 
$\textbf{w}^\text{r}_p(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)$
and $a^r(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)$
on the polar coordinate, as it has been done for $P_\text{nst}$ in \ref{sec:microstructure}. 
However, unlike in \ref{sec:microstructure} we do not assume symmetry with respect to the horizontal plane. 

\subsubsection{Impact of the inertial effects}

The first effect that we study is the impact of the inertial effects on the particles relative kinematic.  
In \ref{fig:Why_Ga_matter} we display the velocity fields $\textbf{w}_p^r$ represented by the arrows that are colored by the mean dimensionless age $a^r$.  
On the left panel, we observe a low inertial case ($Ga = 10$), while on the right panel, we display a highly inertial case ($Ga=100$), both for $\lambda =1$ and $\phi=0.05$.

    \label{fig:Why_Ga_matter}
\end{figure}

The first aspect that we would like to clarify is the non fore-aft symmetry of the velocity fields $\textbf{w}_p^\text{nst}$ with respect to the horizontal plane. 
Indeed, in plots display on \ref{fig:Why_Ga_matter} we remark that the $\textbf{w}_p^\text{nst}$ exhibit a clear asymmetry with respect to the horizontal plane.
This is explained by the non commutativity of the function $h_{ij}$ in the indices $i$ and $j$ in \ref{eq:q_nstij}, as a result $\textbf{w}_p^r(\textbf{x},t,r,\theta) \neq \textbf{w}_p^r(\textbf{x},t,r,-\theta)$. 
Indeed, as it is depicted on \ref{fig:diagram_asym}, in the cases were the neighboring nearest particle is far from the test particle, the chance for this particle to have another nearest neighbor which is closer is high. 
Thus, the nearest neighbor of the nearest neighbor of the test particle, is not necessarily the test particle. 
This induces asymmetry in the nearest neighbor statistics. 
That explains why the plots on \ref{fig:Why_Ga_matter} are not symmetrical when we observe the fields at sufficiently large distance $|\textbf{r}|$. 
Note that this asymmetry would not be present if we had considered classic particle pair average as it is done in \cite{shajahan2023inertial}. 
To summaries, in the situation where we observe $\textbf{w}_p^r$ for large $|\textbf{r}|$ the test particle can be considered as being \textit{isolated}, as its nearest neighbor is at a large distance $|\textbf{r}|$ from the test particle. 
Additionally, the nearest neighboring particle, if located far enough, has 
potentially a nearest neighbor that is closer than the test sphere, as explained on \ref{fig:diagram_asym}. 
Consequently, provided that the nearest neighbor of the test sphere is far enough, we can be sure that on average it approaches a pair of particles or more, that are packed together.

        This is due to the rapid decay of $P_\text{nst}$ for large $|\textbf{r}|/d$, see \ref{fig:Pnst_high_Ga}. 
        In these cases the nearest neighbor of $p_1$ is $p_2$, but the contrary is not true, inducing asymmetry in the statistics.

    \label{fig:diagram_asym}
\end{figure}

Now that this issue has been clarified, we can proceed to interpret the plots in \ref{fig:Why_Ga_matter}.
The beginning of the interactions happen at the early ages, meaning in the dark blue areas in  \ref{fig:Why_Ga_matter}, which are located on the top or bottom of the particle of reference.
The ending of the interactions corresponds to the greater ages, which are represented by the red areas. 
As shown by \ref{fig:Why_Ga_matter} (left), at low \textit{Galileo} number the nearest particle has a tendency to come from the top or bottom and leave through the sides. 
If the nearest particle is at a reasonable distance $|\textbf{r}| < 1.5d$ on the sides of the test particle, we can see that the vertical relative velocity is on average null, but positive in the radial component.
In this area, the age is at its maximum (dark red zone), therefore the interaction come to an end, meaning that the nearest particles get replace by another. 
Note that for the particles at a larger distance of the test particle, say $|\textbf{r}|>2$, have an averaged positive vertical relative velocity. 
As discussed above, in this situation the neighbor on the side is more likely to be closer to another particle. 
Consequently, if the test particle is isolated, with neighboring particles sufficiently far on the side, it will rise on average with a lower velocity than the latter particles.
Thus, particles at contact  seems to get apart because of the non-null radial velocity, and particle at distance seems to get apart because of the non-null vertical velocity.  
Consequently, on average the side-by-side configuration is not stable in this case, which partly explains why the particle distribution doesn't form any layer or such oriented microstructure at these $Ga$.   

% A plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that the leading particle accelerate the trailing particle with its wake on a first stage. 
% Then, the trailing particle arise to the same altitude as the leading particle, but still goes faster than the leading particle due to the acceleration provided by the wake of the latter particle.
% If the particles get in contact then the interaction duration seem to last longer, and the particles might even get trap in a small stagnation zone on the side of the particles.


For high \textit{Galileo} number, see \ref{fig:Why_Ga_matter} (right), the relative averaged velocity is nearly null on the sides and below the test particle. 
It is a statistical representation, meaning that, $\textbf{w}_p^r = 0$, just witnesses of the fact that the particles' relative velocity are not correlated with the relative position in this area. 
Thus, it is hard to say if the area where $\textbf{w}_p^r = 0$ corresponds to actual stagnation zones where both particles are in equilibrium, or if the relative velocity is just not correlated. 
Additionally, the particles at a large distance on the top of the test particle have a downward velocity. 
Meaning that if the test sphere is isolated and approach one or several  particles on the top of it (see \ref{fig:diagram_asym} (\textit{Case 1})), it will eventually catch up the latter particles. 
On the contrary, if the particle is isolated and that the nearest neighbor is at the bottom (see \ref{fig:diagram_asym} (\textit{Case 2})), the velocity is either pointing downward, or it is not correlated with the position, as indicated by the magnitude of $\textbf{w}_p^r$. 
A plausible explanation for this phenomenon is that the reference particle, when being isolated, goes faster than the potentially packed nearest neighbor.
Therefore, the test sphere can either catch up with the nearest particle if it is above, or move further away from it if it is below.
Also, it is interesting to notice that in this case the particles at near contact on the bottom of the test particles results from early interaction, denoted by the dark blue zone. 
It can be interpreted as follows : since 
initial time of interaction is on average low in this zone, it does mean that particles replace an old nearest neighbor that where at near contact of the test particles. 
Thus, in this case the nearest neighbor reaches the test sphere which were rising slowly because of a potentially close neighbor. 

Ultimately, the fields $\textbf{w}^r_p(\textbf{x},\textbf{r}, a)$ provide a quantitative averaged representation of what is known as the \textit{Drafting Kissing Tumbling} \citep{fortes1987nonlinear} mechanism. 
Indeed, in both case particles eventually approach from the verticals (\textit{Drafting}), nearly touch each other (\textit{Kissing}), and leave through the sides (\textit{Tumbling}). 
Statistically, the \textit{Tumbling} part is not present in the high inertial case, which  explains the creation of anisotropic structures or more stable side-by-side configurations. 
For bubble pair interactions \citet{zhang2021three} observed such DKT behavior.
They also reported side-by-side stable configuration of pairs. 
However, at same \textit{Galileo} than  \citet{zhang2021three} ($Ga = 10$) we were not able to identify this pair mechanism. 


To support the deduction made above, we displayed in \ref{fig:unst_ga} the absolute conditioned averaged center of mass velocity of the test sphere, defined as,
\begin{equation*}
    \textbf{u}^\text{r}_p(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)  
    =
    \frac{1}{P_r(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)}
    \int_0^\infty \textbf{u}^\text{nst}_pP_\text{nst}(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t,a) da
\end{equation*}
In \ref{fig:unst_ga} (left) we clearly see that the magnitude of the test particle's vertical velocity is higher than the particle phase vertical velocity $\textbf{u}_p$ when the nearest neighbor is at near contact to the test particle, either above or below.
\begin{figure}[h!]

    \includegraphics[height=0.35\textwidth]{image/HOMOGENEOUS_NEW/Dist/U_l_1_Ga_10_PHI_5.pdf}

    \caption{
         Quiver plots of the conditioned particle velocity field $\textbf{u}^\text{r}(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)$ colored by the averaged dimensionless vertical velocity difference : $(\textbf{u}^\text{r} - \textbf{u}_p )/ \textbf{u}_p$, for $\lambda = 1$ and $\phi = 0.05$.

        (right) High \textit{Galileo} number $Ga = 100$.
         }
    \label{fig:unst_ga}
\end{figure}
When the nearest neighbor is at large distance of the test particle, its average velocity is lower than $\textbf{u}_p$. 
At high inertia however, the test particle velocity is higher when being isolated than with its neighbor at near contact. 
Additionally, we can see that when the particle is on the side at near contact or below, the test sphere's velocity  is lower than the mean. 
In brief in the case of $Ga = 10$ it seems that isolated particles goes slower than close neighbors packed together. 
While at higher \textit{Galileo} number it is the opposite, we observe that isolated particles  goes faster than packed neighbor. 


\subsubsection{The volume fraction dependency}
As it has been observed in \ref{fig:A} the effect of increasing $\phi$ is that it makes the particle distribution slightly more isotropic for $\phi >0.1$. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=0.35\textwidth]{image/HOMOGENEOUS_NEW/Dist/U_rel_l_1_Ga_100_PHI_5.pdf}

    (left) Low \textit{Galileo} number $\phi = 0.05$.
    (right) High \textit{Galileo} number $\phi = 0.2$. }
    \label{fig:Why_Phi_matter}
\end{figure}
In \ref{fig:Why_Phi_matter} we expose two situations with various volume fractions. 
In both graph we observe the same trend, despite the changes in length scales, which are due to the variations in volume fraction. 
Indeed, the stagnation zones with dark red color and the particle resulting from short interactions, dark blue color, are located approximately at the same location. 
We still observe the fore-aft asymmetry with respect to the horizontal plane, as it was discussed above. 
For other $\lambda$ and $Ga$ no particular differences could be observed with varying $\phi$. 
Overall, even if small differences might be present, the change in volume fraction doesn't seem to affect the relative kinematic of interaction between particles. 

\subsubsection{Influence of the viscosity ratio}

Lastly, we turn our attention to the effect of the viscosity ratio on pair relative kinematic.
The question that we are trying to answer is : why does a smaller viscosity ratio increase the anisotropy of the tensor $\textbf{R}(\textbf{x},t)$ as it is shown in \ref{fig:A}. 
With this objective in mind, we compare two cases at $Ga = 100$ and $\phi =0.05$, where we observe a clear difference between the distributions (see \ref{fig:Pnst_high_Ga}) between $\lambda = 1$ and $\lambda = 10$.
\begin{figure}[h!]

    (left) High viscosity ratio $\lambda = 10$.
    (right) Low viscosity ratio, $\lambda = 1$. }
    \label{fig:Why_l_matter}
\end{figure}
As in the previous cases, it is clear that for both cases in \ref{fig:Why_l_matter} the neighboring particle approach on the vertical direction and end up its course on the sides.
As discussed previously, the case on \ref{fig:Why_l_matter} (right) exhibit a clear stagnation zone and asymmetry on a vertical plane. 
On the other hand for $\lambda =10$ the relative velocity on the vicinity of the particle seem to be on average positive in the radial direction. 
In addition, The asymmetry aforementioned is not present in this case. 
As discussed in the previous paragraph, and explained by \ref{fig:diagram_asym}, the presence of the skew asymmetry in the fields $\textbf{w}_p^\text{r}$ about horizontal plane, witnesses for interactions of the isolated particles clusters of particles.
The absence of such asymmetry implies the absence of such interactions, indicating that the particles are more evenly spread. 

As before, it is interesting to investigate the value of the conditional velocity $\textbf{u}^r_p$ to better understand the particles collective interactions. 
Thus, \ref{fig:unst_l} display the fields  $\textbf{u}_p^\text{r}$ for both cases. 
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[height=0.35\textwidth]{image/HOMOGENEOUS_NEW/Dist/U_l_10_Ga_100_PHI_5.pdf}

         Quiver plots of the conditioned particle velocity field $\textbf{u}^\text{r}(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)$ colored by the averaged dimensionless vertical velocity difference : $(\textbf{u}^\text{r} - \textbf{u}_p )/ \textbf{u}_p$, for $\phi = 0.05$ and $Ga = 100$. 
         (left) High viscosity ratio $\lambda = 10$.
         (right) Low viscosity ratio, $\lambda = 1$.
         }
    \label{fig:unst_l}
\end{figure}
On \ref{fig:unst_l} (left) we first notice that $\textbf{u}^\text{r}(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t)$ behave similarly as the low inertial case display on \ref{fig:unst_ga} (left).
However, for $\lambda = 10$, the isolated particles' velocity is roughly equal to $\textbf{u}_p$. 
If isolated particle rise at the average velocity it is because the isolated particles constitute the majority of the realization since the trace of \textbf{R} is rather high, see \ref{fig:A}.
Therefore, this fact is not particularly relevant as it is just a statistical bias. 
Nevertheless, we can still conclude that for $\lambda = 10$ particles goes faster with a nearest neighbor on top or bottom, while for  $\lambda = 1$ particles goes faster when the nearest neighbor is at large distance. 



\subsubsection{Discussion}

From \ref{sec:time} we demonstrated that $\textbf{R}(\textbf{x},t)$ follows a transport equation were the tensor $\textbf{W}(\textbf{x},t)$ act as a source term. 
This tensor might be expressed as the symmetric part of $\int_0^\infty \textbf{r} \textbf{w}_p^\text{r} P(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t) da$. 
Thus, the trends of the $\textbf{w}_p^\text{r}(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t) $ in terms of the position determine the value of $\textbf{W}(\textbf{x},t)$ and partly determine the final value of $\textbf{R}(\textbf{x},t)$. 
In most of the graphs we observed that the vertical components of $\textbf{w}_p^\text{r}$ where negative when the vertical component of where positive \textbf{r} and vice versa. 
Consequently, $W_{yy}$ must be on average negative, which ultimately contribute to the value of $\textbf{R}(\textbf{x},t)$ and $\textbf{A}(\textbf{x},t)$ through \ref{eq:dt_R} and justify the sign of $A_{xx}$ in \ref{fig:A}.

Is the relative velocity fields $\textbf{w}_p^r$ is the cause of the microstructure's shape as it is suggested by \ref{eq:dt_R}. 
Or does $\textbf{w}_p^r$ is the consequence of microstructure shape, as it could be through looking at the previous graphs ?
Indeed, on \ref{fig:Why_l_matter} (right), the clear asymmetry with respect to the horizontal plane can be explained as the consequence of cluster  in the flows. 
Although it is tedious question, we believe that both are true, even if physical parameters also impact $\textbf{w}_p^r$, which makes the microstructure case dependent.  
Nevertheless, this makes $\textbf{W}(\textbf{x},t)$ potentially a function of $\textbf{R}(\textbf{x},t)$.
Depending on its relationship with $\textbf{R}(\textbf{x},t)$ this might modify the relaxation time.  
Thus, a more efficient way to close \textbf{W} by an objective manner would be to study the dynamic of interactions. 
In this work we only provided a kinematics arguments to explain the microstructure shape. 
Of course to fully understand the physics one has to study the dynamic of interaction. 
It is in fact possible in our framework to include such dynamic variable by deriving an equation for \textbf{W} the same way we derived \ref{eq:dt_R} for \textbf{R}.
% In this case it is reasonable to believe that the closure terms for the dynamical equation might be computable theoretically in terms of the physical parameters $Ga$, $\phi$ and $\lambda$.
