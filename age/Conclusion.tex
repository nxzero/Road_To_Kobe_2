The advancement conducted in this study provide a numerical framework to perform statistically steady simulation of rising emulsion with non coalescing droplets.
Additionally, we provide a theoretical framework based on solid theoretical ground to measure the microstructure geometry and timescale of the microstructure as well as the one of the particles interactions.
The major advancement can be sum up into 4 key points :
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Based on \ref{eq:dt_R} we could infer that the time of relaxation of $\textbf{R}(\textbf{x},t)$, is the mean age of interaction of the  nearest particles pairs $\tau_p(\textbf{x},t)$. 
    Likewise, we could show that the relative velocity between particles pairs scales as $\tau_p /d_p$ for all our cases, while its time of relaxation is also $\tau_p$. 
    The trends of $\tau_p$ have also been captured, it is shown to be longer for $\lambda = 1$, and shorter for $\lambda = 10$, and even shorter for solid particles at same $Ga$ and $\phi$. 
    \tb{tau p is the only non ambigous way to define a time of conatct for droplets}
    \item By studying \ref{eq:dt_R} we demonstrated that the correlation between $\textbf{w}_p^\text{nst}$ and \textbf{r}, acts as a source terms for $\textbf{R}(\textbf{x},t)$, which motivated us to study the particles relative velocity conditioned on the relative position. 
    By a careful analysis of $\textbf{w}_p^\text{r}$ and $\textbf{u}_p^\text{r}$, we could show that for $\lambda = 10$ particles goes faster with a nearest neighbor on top or bottom, while for $\lambda = 1$ particles goes faster when the nearest neighbor is at large distance.
    Additionally, we could clearly identify and quantify phenomena such as the DKT mechanism and its derivatives. 
\end{enumerate}

This study has been motivated with the view of building a coalescence kernel as well as other closure terms for averaged dispersed two-phase flow equations and PBE. 
These coalescence models are often based on film drainage approximations which assume a normal approach between droplets \citet{chesters1991modelling}.  
However, in \ref{sec:velocity}, we have seen that the interactions are more likely to happen tangentially rather than with a normal approach. 
We also demonstrated that $\lambda$ and $Ga$ have a strong impact on the spatial arrangement of the particles and on their relative kinematics. 
For these reasons we conclude that there is a clear need to take in account these mechanisms, with the objective of building more accurate coalescence kernels. 
This could be done by considering more sophisticated film drainage situations which would consider relative velocities consistent with $\textbf{w}^\text{nst}(\textbf{x},\textbf{r},t,a)$ distributions documented in this study.
More globally, the coalescence kernel might be re phrase in the context of the nearest particle statistic to incorporate the various form of $P_\text{nst}$. 
These issues will be addressed in future work.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item use for model of coalesce with relative vel etc
        \item that can serve the pseudoturbulence modeling 
    \end{itemize}
