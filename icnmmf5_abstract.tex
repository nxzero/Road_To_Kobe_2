\maketitle

The population balance and averaged Navier Stokes equations have been used in engineering for decades. 
However, there is a clear lack of accurate closure regarding the coalescence source term in emulsion modeling.  
Therefore, in a multiscale strategy 
We used the code Basilisk ({http://basilisk.fr}) to perform tri-periodic simulations of buoyant emulsions, see Figure \ref{fig:tower}~(left). 
In addition, to providing data for the closure terms appearing in the averaged models (PBE and averaged Navier-Stokes equations), tri-periodic simulations are of great interest to understand and describe pairwise interactions of rising droplets. Witch is crucial information, if we wish to model coalescence phenomenon based on film drainage analysis. 

Therefore, in this work, we present a statistical analysis based on the recent Nearest Particle Statistics framework of \cite{zhang2021ensemble}.
We define a pair by a particle and its nearest neighbor. 
This enables us to get the averaged relative or absolute characteristics of droplets pairs during collisions.
% , and thus deduce the nature of the average interaction. 
From this analysis we are able to propose a qualitative description of :
the relative position of particles, the relative kinematic and dynamical behavior of colliding pairs (see Figure \ref{fig:tower}~(middle)), the wake of a non-isolated particle (see Figure \ref{fig:tower}~(middle)).
From the observation of these statistics we can clearly identify drafting kissing thumbing mechanism, clustering phenomenon and the different wake produce by the droplets.   
We also provide quantitative results such as the
% mean time of interaction and the mean kinematic energy loss during an interaction. 
the particle-fuild-particle stress tensor, such as it is defined in \cite{zhang2021ensemble} (see \ref{fig:tower}~(right)). 
This tensor describes long range interaction between droplets through the fluid and has been shown to be crucial to ensure the hyperbolicity of the averaged NS equations \cite{fox2022hyperbolic}. 

Overall, we provide an intuitive understanding of pairwise interactions between particles, but also between the ambient fluid and the particles.
