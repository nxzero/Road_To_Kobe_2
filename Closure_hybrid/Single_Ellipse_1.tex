\subsection{Spheroidal fluid particles}

Many studies have been conducted to determine the influence of the droplets' deformation on suspension Rheology \citet{goddard1967nonlinear,lhuillier1987phenomenology,maffettone1998equation}.
Most of the authors considered the Rheology of such an emulsion for neutrally buoyant droplets in shearing flow. 
In this work we would to present a first glimps  of the form Rheology of deformable droplets or bubbles with relative motion. 
As a first step to describe the rheology we are interested in the kinematic and dynamic of a single deformable drop. 
In \ref{sec:Exemples} we study the case of 

\subsubsection*{The drop shape}

In this study we consider spheroidal particles described by a conformation tensor that we note $\textbf{C}_\alpha(t)$.  
This tensor is defined such that its eigenvalues are the dimensionless square length of the semi-axis of the spheroid minus one, such that $\textbf{C}_\alpha = (a_1^2/a^2 - 1) \textbf{pp} + (a_2^2 /a^2 - 1) (\textbf{I}-\textbf{pp})$ where $r$ is the radius of the sphere of same volume and \textbf{p} the orientation vector of the particle (see Figure \ref{fig:scheme2}).  
In this way $\textbf{C}_\alpha = 0$ when the particle is spherical and  $\textbf{C}_\alpha + \textbf{I}$ is equivalent to the Cauchy strain tensor well-defined in solid mechanics \citet{mwasame2017macroscopic}. 
In a general coordinate system the point on the surface of the spheroid verify the relation, 
\begin{equation*}
    \textbf{r}\cdot(\textbf{C}_\alpha + \textbf{I})^{-1}\cdot\textbf{r} = a^2,
\end{equation*}
\tb{is it really usefull to define this traceless matrix instead of the actual ellipse}
where $^{-1}$ is the inverse operator.  
One can verify that the second order moment of mass of the particles is related to the conformation tensor through, $\textbf{M}_\alpha = \frac{m_\alpha  a^2}{5} (\textbf{C}_\alpha + \textbf{I})$. 
The last property of the of this tensor is that it the constant volume conservation can be obtained by ensuring that $\text{det}(\textbf{C}_\alpha +\textbf{I}) = (a_1a_2^2)^2 /(a^6) = 1$.

\subsubsection*{The droplet internal velocity}

The internal velocity of a solid elastic particle following a homogeneous linear deformation can be described such as $\textbf{w}_2^0 = \bm\Gamma_\alpha \cdot \textbf{r}$ where we have introduced, $\bm\Gamma_\alpha$, the mean velocity gradient inside the particle, which symmetric part : $\textbf{E}_\alpha$, represents the rate of strain, and skew symmetric part : $\bm\Omega_\alpha$, represents the angular velocity. 
Even through the velocity fields $\textbf{w}_2^0 = \bm\Gamma_\alpha \cdot \textbf{r}$  can apply for liquid deforming droplet, an additional flow is present. 
Indeed, from the solution of the stokes equations we can predict the flow within a spherical isolated drop immersed in an unbounded fluid. 
Especially, we know that an solated droplet in translation exhibit internal motion known as Hill vortexes, see \ref{fig:flowlines} (b). 
For a drop immersed in an unbounded linear flow we can also derive an analytical solution such that $\textbf{w}_2^0 \sim \textbf{rrr}$, see \ref{fig:flowlines} (a). 
Therefore, the droplet's internal velocity fields is constituted with a component accounting for the complex internal motions that does not alter the shape of the drop, and another component that account for the linear deformation of the drop.

\end{figure*}
Consequently, the particle internal velocity might be written, 
\begin{equation}
    \textbf{w}_{2,i}^0(\textbf{x}_\alpha)
    = \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,ik}(t) \cdot \textbf{r}_k
    + \textbf{w}^{s}_{2,i}(t,\textbf{r})
    =\bm{\Omega}_{\alpha,ik}\cdot \textbf{r}_k
    + \textbf{E}_{\alpha,ik} \cdot \textbf{r}_k
    + \textbf{w}^{s}_{2,i}(t,\textbf{r})
\end{equation}
Where we introduced the vector $\textbf{w}^{s}_2(t,\textbf{r}) =\textbf{w}^{0}_{2,i}(t,\textbf{r})  - \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,ik}(t) \cdot \textbf{r}_k$ which represents all the internal motions that does not alter the drop's shape. 
Examples of such motions are displayed \ref{fig:flowlines}. 


From now on we consider that the internal velocity $\textbf{w}^{s}_2(t,\textbf{r})$ is not part of the particles unknown, but a function entirely determined by the particle and flow properties such that $\textbf{w}^{s}_2(t,\textbf{r}) =f_\textbf{w}(\textbf{u}_\alpha,\textbf{C}_\alpha,\bm\Gamma_\alpha,\textbf{u}_1,\bm \Gamma_1,\phi_2) $, where $\bm\Gamma_1 = \grad \textbf{u}_1$ and $\textbf{u}_1$ is the mean velocity fields evaluated at the particle position. 
As it is demonstrated in \ref{ap:Translating_sphere} the internal motion of an isolated spherical drop such as the one in \ref{eq:def_vel} might be determined theoretically from the relative motion and flow fields gradient in the limit of low Reynolds number.
We assume that such a relation exist for other regime. 
Consequently, The particle mean velocity gradient $\bm\Gamma_\alpha$ and its conformation tensor $\textbf C_\alpha$ are the only unknown of our problem. 
Therefore, we need to provide two equations, one for $\textbf{C}_\alpha$ and another for $\bm\Gamma_\alpha$. 

\subsubsection*{Kinematic and dynamic of a deformable spheroid}

The evolution of $\textbf{C}_\alpha$ and $\bm\Gamma_\alpha$ will be described by the second moment of mass and first moment of momentum equation.
Consequently, we must reformulate the terms in \ref{eq:dt_M_alpha} and \ref{eq:dt_P_alpha} in terms of $\textbf{C}_\alpha$ and $\bm\Gamma_\alpha$. 
The integrals constitutive of these moments equations can be written, 
\begin{align}
    \intO{(\textbf{rw}_2^0 )_{ij}+ (\textbf{w}_2^0 \textbf{r})_{ij}} 
    = \textbf{C}_{\alpha,ik} \cdot \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,kj}
    +  \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,ki} \cdot \textbf{C}_{\alpha,jk}
    +  \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,ij} + \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,ij}

    = \frac{m_\alpha a^2}{5}[

        + \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,kj}\bm\Gamma_{\alpha,ki} 
        % + f_\textbf{ww}(\textbf{u}_\alpha,\textbf{C}_\alpha,\bm\Gamma_\alpha,\textbf{u}_1,\bm \Gamma_1,\phi_2)

First, as discussed above only the deforming motion contribute to the symmetric part of the moment of momentum, we could therefore express it explicitly in terms of the particle unknown. 
Regarding the first moment of the surface tension, it has been computed analytically carrying a surface integral on the ellipsoidal surface of the droplet. 
Since, the droplets remain spheroidal under small deformation we choose to approximate $\intS{\bm\sigma_I^0}$ with its first order Taylor series in $\textbf{C}_\alpha$ without lost of generality.
Note that our expression of $\intS{\bm\sigma_I^0}$ is in agreement with \citet{lhuillier1987phenomenology} if one account for the slight difference of his definition of the deformation tensor which is half of $\textbf{C}_{\alpha}$. 
% in which our $\textbf{C}_\alpha$ is twice his, in the limit of small \textbf{C}_\alpha.
For the expression of $\intO{\rho_2 \textbf{w}_{2,i}^0\textbf{w}_{2,j}^0}$, $ \intO{\bm\sigma_{2,ij}^0}$ we had to introduce two unknown functions, $f_\textbf{ww}$, $f_{\bm{\sigma}}$, which vanish when $\textbf{w}^s_2 =0$. 
Therefore, these expressions are a sum of a function involving $\bm\Gamma_\alpha$ and an unknown part which depend on the parameters of the problem and need to be closed. 
The expression of $\intO{\rho_2 \textbf{w}_{2,i}^0\textbf{w}_{2,j}^0}$, $ \intO{\bm\sigma_{2,ij}^0}$ and $\intS{\textbf{r}\bm\sigma_1^0\cdot \textbf{n}_2}$ are very problem dependent. 
To provide a clearer example we computed these terms in \ref{ap:Translating_sphere} in the simplified scenario of an isolated droplet in a general linear flow. 

% The most common example is the expression for first moment \textbf{M}, which has been widely investigated in the pure straining situation, an example is given in \ref{ap:Translating_sphere} for spherical drop, and in \citet{raja2010inertial} for slightly deformable droplet in inertial flows. 
% It is important to notice that these functions are dependent of the relative drop-carrier fluid velocity, in such a way that the momentum and first moment of momentum are linked through the function $f_{\textbf{ww}},f_{\bm{\sigma}}$ and $\intS{\textbf{r}\bm\sigma_1^0\cdot \textbf{n}_2}$. 
% Indeed, even if it has been uniquely studied in pure linear flows, the relative motion of a particle might generate a first moment on its surface. 


At this point it wouldn't be wise trying to find an expression for each of these unknown functions in such a generality. 
Instead, we expose the unclosed set of equation of motions for spheroidal particles. 
In addition to the previously exposed equations (mass, momentum and energy equation) this system is constituted of three equations, one for $\textbf{C}_\alpha$ and two equation for the moment of momentum, the symmetric and skew-symmetric moment of momentum. 
% These read, 
\begin{align*}
    \ddt \textbf{C}_{\alpha,ij}
    = \textbf{C}_{\alpha,ik} \cdot \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,kj}
    +  \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,ki} \cdot \textbf{C}_{\alpha,jk},\\
    \frac{a^2  m_\alpha}{5} \ddt( \textbf{C}_{ik} \cdot \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,kj}
    -  \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,ki} \cdot \textbf{C}_{jk})
    =  \intS{(\textbf{r}\bm\sigma_2^0- \bm\sigma_2^0\textbf{r})\cdot \textbf{n}}\\
    \frac{m_\alpha a^2}{5}\ddt^2 \textbf{C}_\alpha
    - \frac{m_\alpha a^2}{5}[
    \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,lj}\bm\Gamma_{\alpha,ki} \textbf{C}_{\alpha,kl} + f_\textbf{ww}]
    + \mu_2 v_\alpha [(\bm \Gamma_{p,ij}+\bm \Gamma_{p,ji})
    + f_{\bm{\sigma}}]\\
    + \frac{2 \gamma v_\alpha }{a} \textbf{I}_{ij} 
    - \frac{4 \gamma v_\alpha }{5 a} (\textbf{C}_{ij} - \textbf{I}_{ij})
    = \intS{(\textbf{r}\bm\sigma_2^0+ \bm\sigma_2^0\textbf{r})\cdot \textbf{n}}
    % + \textbf{I}_{ij}\intO{p_2^0}
\end{align*}
% Where we placed the unknown function at the right hands side of these equations. 
Now, we would like to propose a more intuitive interpretation of the mass and momentum equations.
To that end, we make the problem dimensionless by introducing, 
the \textit{Capillary number} $Ca= \frac{\mu_1 U}{\gamma}$, The viscosity ratio $\lambda = \mu_2/\mu_1$, the density ratio $\zeta = \rho_2/\rho_1$ and the Reynolds number $Re = \frac{a U \rho_1}{\mu_1}$, with $U$ as the velocity scale. 
%  such that  $\bm\Gamma_\alpha'  = \frac{a}{U}\bm\Gamma$, and $\tau_a$ the timescale related to the drop shape evolution.
In the low Reynolds regime the first moment of surface traction forces will be proportional to a viscous stress (see \ref{ap:Translating_sphere}), therefore :$\intS{\textbf{r}\bm\sigma_2^0\cdot \textbf{n}} =\mu_1  \tau v_\alpha \intS{\textbf{r}\bm\sigma_2^0\cdot \textbf{n}}^*$, with $\tau$ the inverse timescale of the external solicitation.
The ratio between the external flow scale $\tau$ and the drop timescale $\tau_a$ is noted $\beta$. 
With that in mind, \ref{eq:dt_M_alpha}, \ref{eq:dt_mu_alpha} and \ref{eq:dt_S_alpha} might be written :
\begin{align}
    \beta \ddt \textbf{C}_{\alpha,ij}
    - \textbf{C}_{\alpha,ik} \cdot \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,kj}^*
    - \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,ki}^* \cdot \textbf{C}_{\alpha,jk},
    = 
    \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,ij}^*
    +  \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,ji}^*\\
    Re \zeta \beta \ddt( \textbf{C}_{\alpha,ik} \cdot \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,kj}^*
    -  \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,ki}^* \cdot \textbf{C}_{\alpha,jk}
    + \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,ji} - \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,ij})
    =  \intS{(\textbf{r}\bm\sigma_2^0- \bm\sigma_2^0\textbf{r})\cdot \textbf{n}}^*\\
    \zeta Re \frac{1}{5}  
    \left[
        \frac{1}{2}\beta^2 \ddt^2_* \textbf{C}_\alpha
        - \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,lj}^* \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,ki}^* \textbf{C}_{\alpha,kl}^* 
        - \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,kj}^* \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,ki}^* 
        - f_\textbf{ww}
    \right]\nonumber\\
    + \lambda \left[
        \beta \ddt \textbf{C}_{\alpha,ij}
        -\textbf{C}_{\alpha,ik} \cdot \bm\Gamma_{\alpha,kj}

        + f_{\bm{\sigma}}
    \right]\nonumber\\
    - \frac{1}{Ca}\left[
        \frac{4}{5} \textbf{C}_{\alpha,ij}
        +2 \textbf{I}_{ij} 
    \right]
    =
    \frac{1}{2}\intS{(\textbf{r}\bm\sigma_1^0+ \bm\sigma_1^0\textbf{r})\cdot \textbf{n}}^*
\end{align}
\tb{at this point it is not usefull to introduce the substitution in the last equaiton instead explain that it is proportional to the derivative in the limit}
The second moment of mass \ref{eq:dt_Cs}, is consistent with the equation found by \citet{goddard1967nonlinear} and \citet{lhuillier1987phenomenology}. 
Following, \citet{goddard1967nonlinear}  terminology, the left-hand side of \ref{eq:dt_Cs} is referred as the \textit{convected} derivative of $\textbf{C}^*_\alpha$. 
Therefore, the \textit{convected} derivative of $\textbf{C}_\alpha$ is equal to the rate of strain of the particle. 
The skew-symmetric part of the first moment of momentum \ref{eq:dt2_C}, it is basically the angular momentum balance of a non-spherical object. 
The right-hands side accounting for the external torque contribution. 
The symmetric part however has the form of a non-linear forced harmonic oscillatory equation for the droplet deformation. 
Indeed, the first groups of terms on the left-hand side represent the inertial contribution of the droplet internal fluid. 
It is made of a second order derivative plus non-linear terms in $\bm\Gamma_\alpha$. 
The second groups of terms is internal viscous contribution that arise directly from the definition of the stress \ref{eq:sigma_2_def}. 
It vanishes for small viscosity ration and is linear in the first derivative of $\textbf{C}_\alpha$. 
The last term on the left-hand side is the elastic response from the interface which is negligible for high capillary number $Ca \to \infty$. 
Then on right-hand side of the equation we find the first moment of surface force, $\intS{(\textbf{r}\bm\sigma_1^0+ \bm\sigma_1^0\textbf{r})\cdot \textbf{n}}^*$ which has an unknown expression at this stage. 
\ref{eq:dt2_C} might be regarded as a second order harmonic equation with non-linear contributions. 
However, the unknown function $f_\textbf{ww},\ f_{\bm{\sigma}}$ and $\intS{(\textbf{r}\bm\sigma_1^0+ \bm\sigma_1^0\textbf{r})\cdot \textbf{n}}^*$ are in general function of $\textbf{C}_\alpha$ and its higher derivatives of $\textbf{C}_\alpha$.   
Therefore, at this stage it is impossible to predict the nature of the harmonic regime followed by the droplet. 
To conclude on this matter one must find an expression for all this closure as well as determinate the impact of the non-linear terms.

We now examine the specific case studied by \citet{lamb1924hydrodynamics} where he considered no external contribution around the particle, therefore, $\intS{(\textbf{r}\bm\sigma_1^0+ \bm\sigma_1^0\textbf{r})\cdot \textbf{n}}^* = 0$.
It is found, that the amplitude of the second order harmonic mode of deformation, noted $\epsilon_2$, follows the second order partial differential equations,  
\begin{equation*}
    \ddt^2{\epsilon_2}
    + 2\lambda_2 \ddt \epsilon_2
    + \omega_2^2 \epsilon_2
     = 0,
\end{equation*}
where $\lambda_2$ and $\omega_2$ are the damping and frequency of coefficient defined as, 
\begin{align*}
    \lambda_2 = 5 \frac{\mu_2}{\rho_2a^2},
    && \omega_2 = \sqrt{8 \frac{\mu_2}{\rho_2 a^2}}.
\end{align*}
Where this equation has been obtained in the linear deformation regime for $\epsilon_2 \ll 1$. 
When multiplying \ref{eq:dt2_C} by, $\frac{10}{\zeta Re}$ we indeed find the exact same coefficient $\lambda_2$ and $\omega_2^2$ in front of, $\ddt \textbf{C}_{\alpha,ij}$ and $\textbf{C}_{\alpha,ij}$, respectively. 
In the limit of small $\textbf{C}_\alpha$, only these linear terms remain, therefore consistent with the reference work of \citet{lamb1924hydrodynamics}. 
\ref{eq:dt2_C} is somewhat more general than lamb's solution since it is expressed in an arbitrary reference frame. 
Which will prove to be useful in \ref{sec:Exemples} were we apply ensemble average on these quantities. 
However, with this equation we are able to describe only the second oscillatory mode. 
To study higher order modes one must use higher moment of momentum equations. 

In the past studies, the coupling between translational and oscillating nature of rising bubbles or droplets have been investigated \citet{lalanne2013effect}. 
For an isolated spherical droplet in translation through a stokes or potential flow we know that $
    f_\textbf{ww}
    = \frac{m_\alpha}{140 (\lambda +1)^2}
    (7 \textbf{u}_{\alpha 1} \textbf{u}_{\alpha 1} + \textbf{u}_{\alpha 1}\cdot \textbf{u}_{\alpha 1}\textbf{I})$, 
(see \ref{ap:Translating_sphere}). 
It is reasonable to guess that for a slightly spheroidal droplet in translation the expression might preserve the same form. 
Indeed, a coefficient related to $\textbf{C}_\alpha$ might appear in the expression nevertheless the overall contribution must be still proportional to $\textbf{u}_{\alpha 1} \textbf{u}_{\alpha 1}$. 
Likewise, for an inertial drops, it might be found that 
$\intS{(\textbf{r}\bm\sigma_1^0+ \bm\sigma_1^0\textbf{r})\cdot \textbf{n}}^* \sim A \textbf{u}_{\alpha 1} \textbf{u}_{\alpha 1} + B \textbf{u}_{\alpha 1} \cdot \textbf{u}_{\alpha 1}$ where $A$ and $B$ are constant. 
Indeed, the translational motion a spherical particle at slight inertia induce an overall unbalance stress on the surface of the particle generating a first moment \citet{taylor1964deformation}. 
The point is that the yet unknown closures, will help us bridge translational and drop's straining motions. 
Therefore, injecting these expressions into \ref{eq:dt2_C} would be a first step to accomplish a coupling between oscillating, or deforming motion with translating motion.
This is the subject of the last section. 
Obviously, now that we obtained a general formulation for the dynamic of the droplets' deformation, the most challenging aspect is to find expressions for closure terms. 


\subsubsection*{The particle internal energy balance.}

The surface of the particles, and internal kinetic energy can be written in this context as, 
\begin{align*}
    \beta \ddt \textbf{C}_{\alpha,ij}

    \right]
\end{align*}

\begin{equation}
    \ddt (W_\alpha + \gamma s_\alpha)
    + \intO{ \bm{\sigma}_2^0 : \grad\textbf{u}_2^0 }
    =\intS{\textbf{w}_1^0 \cdot \bm{\sigma}_1^0 \cdot \textbf{n}_2} 
\end{equation}

In conclusion, we have demonstrated how the first and second moment of momentum and mass equation can be used to describe the second mode oscillatory motion of a spheroidal drop in a Galilean reference frame. 
Therefore, the moment of momentum is a quantity of utmost importance for all kinds of particles with variable shape or volume.
This isn't limited to the momentum distribution, but all kind of properties can be described that way. 
In fact, if one wish to describe the first moment of the distribution of any local quantity $f_2^0$ and $f_I^0$ over the surface or volume of the particle, he must use the first moments' conservation equations. 
As an example, the mean concentration and distribution of surfactants on the bubbles' surface have a significant impact on the mass transfer rate between the dispersed and continuous phases.
In this case first moment of surfactant concentration could be considered here to track the evolution of the surfactant concentration and orientation over the particle surface, which would enable us to compute a better approximation of the drag force coefficient.
