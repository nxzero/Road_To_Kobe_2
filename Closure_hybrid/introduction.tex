In many industrial or environmental situations, particles, drops or bubbles are dispersed in a
carrier fluid. Understanding and modeling dispersed flows is therefore a major issue for many
applications including chemical engineering (bubble columns, water treatment, fluidized beds,
oil refining), nuclear industry (boiling in steam generators, containment spray systems),
environmental engineering (sediment transport, coastal erosion, river restauration), geophysics
(volcanic processes, fluid migration in sedimentary basins), astrophysics (protoplanetary dust,
planet formation) and combustion applications (atomization, spray combustion).
