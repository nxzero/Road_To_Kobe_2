We now present the final averaged system of equations describing the averaged shape that the droplets adopt in a dispersed multiphase flow. 
As, discussed earlier we decided to describe the droplets based on their orientation $\textbf{p}$ and the aspect ratio $\chi_I$.
Consequently, at the cross-grained level we would like to determine the mean, or averaged orientation of the particles, and the average aspect ratio of the particles.  
To simplify the problem at hand we consider a mono-disperse emulsions, meaning that all droplets have same volume. 

As it will be demonstrated the averaged equations for the orientation corresponds in lots of way to what is done in fiber media theory. 
Indeed, we transport a quantity corresponding to the average of the tensor $\textbf{pp}$ which is completed by an equation for the mean angular momentum. 
Due to the particular nature of the particles it will be shown that the closure problem becomes quite complicated, and therefore not much progress can be done regarding the orientation equation. 
The equation for the mean aspect ratio angular momentum and averaged rate of strain are then derived, in the particle eigenbasis.





% \subsubsection{Averaged equations for the mean deformation in the local basis}
\subsection{Fundamental Averaged properties of the dispersed phase} 

As discussed in the preceding section we reduced the description of the shape of a particle to the scalar $E_I$ and $\chi_I$. 
Thus, the aim of this section is to present the equations of the average deformation for slightly deformable drops.     
But before let us present the link between the averaged deformation tensor and rate of strain tensor, namely, 
\begin{align*}
    n_p \bm\chi_p = \pavg{\bm\chi_\alpha}\\
    n_p \textbf{E}_p = \pavg{\textbf{E}_\alpha},
\end{align*}
with the averaged particle main deformation and main rate of strain, namely, 
\begin{align*}
    n_p \chi_p(\textbf{x},t) = \pavg{\chi_I(\textbf{x},t,\FF)},\\
    n_p E_p(\textbf{x},t) = \pavg{E_I(\textbf{x},t,\FF)},
    % n_p \bm\omega_p(\textbf{x},t) = \pavg{\bm\omega_I(\textbf{x},t,\FF)},
\end{align*}
respectively. 
We recall here that all the local quantities that are not averaged are function of the local position, $\textbf{x}$ time $t$ and flow configurations $\FF$. 
The averaged quantities are theretofore, only function of the position and time. 
As follows from the definition of $\bm\chi_\alpha$ in the limit of small deformation, 
\begin{equation}
    n_p \bm\chi_p
    = \chi_p
    \frac{1}{2}\left[
        3\textbf{A}_p 
        - \bm\delta
    \right]
    + \frac{3}{2}\avg{(\chi_I - \chi_p) \textbf{pp} }, 
    \label{eq:chi_p_def}
\end{equation}
Thus, the mean orientation tensor $\textbf{A}_p = \pavg{\textbf{pp}}$ and mean principal deformation $\chi_p$ are not sufficient to recover the mean deformation tesnor $\bm\chi_p$.
Indeed, as exemplified by \ref{eq:chi_p_def} one needs in addition the covariance term $\avg{(\chi_I - \chi_p) \textbf{pp} }$ which is the correlation between the orientation and deformation. 
Same comments can be made regarding the shear rate of the particles. 
As it will be seen latter, the explicit expression of $\bm\chi_p$ and $\textbf{E}_p$ are not necessarily needed in the other equations of the system. 
Thus, solving for the particle mean eigenvalue, can be interesting upon having closures terms function of this means eigenvalues.
In any case it must be sated that solving for the mean eigenvalues and for the mean orientation tensor is surely not equivalent than solving for the whole tensor $\bm\chi_p$. 
Nevertheless, the gain in computational expenses might make it worth it. 

Regarding the particle angular rotation, we have shown that in the local basis, $\bm\omega_\alpha  = \omega^i \textbf{p}^i$ where $\omega^i$ corresponds to the components of the rotation vector on the $i^{th}$ eigenvector of the local basis.
We have seen that solving for the components of $\bm\omega_\alpha$ in the local basis of the particle simplify greatly the angular momentum equation, see \ref{eq:dt_omega_I}.  
In average the $\omega^i_p$ are related to $\bm\omega_p$ through the relation, 
\begin{equation*}
    n_p \bm\omega_p
    = \pavg{\bm\omega_\alpha}
    =\pavg{\omega^i \textbf{p}^i}
    =n_p \omega^i_p   \textbf{p}_p^i
    +\pavg{(\omega^i)' \textbf{p}^i}
    \label{eq:omega_p_local}
\end{equation*}
where $\textbf{p}_p^i$ is the average orientation vector, this term is therefor $0$ when the particle orientation is random.  
Unlike $\bm\chi_p$ and $\textbf E_p$ the vector $\bm\omega_p$ appears explicitly in the orientation equation. 
Thus, as explicated by this equation solving for the average of the particle angular rotation introduce the need of the closure terms $\pavg{(\omega^i)' \textbf{p}^i}$.

\subsection{Orientation equation in stoke regime.}

Let us first derive the equation for the mean orientation tensor $\textbf{A}_p$. 
This is easily done by averaging \ref{eq:dt_pp}, the resulting equation is given by~:
\begin{equation}
    \pddt (n_p\textbf{A})
    + \div (
        n_p\textbf{u}_p\textbf{A}_p
        + \mathbf{\Sigma}
        )
    =
    \pavg{\textbf{pp} \times \bm\omega_\alpha}
    + \pavg{\bm\omega_\alpha \times \textbf{pp}},
    % + \pnavg{\textbf{pp}' \times \omega_\alpha'}
    % +\pnavg{\omega_\alpha' \times \textbf{pp}'}
    \label{eq:avg_dt_pp_alpha}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{\Sigma} = \pavg{\textbf{u}'_\alpha(\textbf{pp})'}$ is the covariance term between the fluctuation of the velocity and the orientation tensor.

For purpose of understanding we now show how this equation is in fact the starting point of the usual equations used fiber media theory. 
Indeed, if we assume torque free rigid particle in to Stokes flow, where we can utilize Jeffery's equation \citep{guazzelli2011} we may use the relation,
\begin{equation}
    \omega_\alpha \times \textbf{p}
    = \bm{\Omega}_f\cdot\textbf{p}
    + \beta\left(
        \textbf{E}_f\cdot \textbf{p}
        - \textbf{E}_f : \textbf{ppp}
    \right),
    \label{eq:jefferey}
\end{equation}
with $\textbf{E}_f$ and $\bm{\Omega}_f$ being the symmetric and antisymmetric parts of the bulk velocity gradient, respectively, such that $\grad\avg{\textbf{u}}=\textbf{E}_f+\bm{\Omega}_f$.
The coefficient $\beta$  is a constant related to the aspect ratio of the particle.
Finally, by substituting the RHS terms of \ref{eq:avg_dt_pp_alpha}, by using \ref{eq:jefferey}, we arrive at the closed form of the second moment of mass equation~:
\begin{equation}
    \pddt \textbf{A}
    + \div (
        \pnnavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha}\textbf{A}
    )
    =
    \bm{\Omega}_f \cdot \textbf{A}
    - \textbf{A} \cdot \bm{\Omega}_f
    + \beta\left[
        \textbf{E}_f \cdot \textbf{A}
        -\textbf{A} \cdot \textbf{E}_f
        - \textbf{E}_f : \mathbb{A}
    \right]
    - \div \mathbf{\Sigma}
    \label{eq:hybrid_avg_dt_pp}
\end{equation}
where the fourth-order tensor $\mathbb{A}_p$, is defined as $\mathbb{A}_p = \pavg{\textbf{pppp}}$.
In this expression we have removed the fluctuation terms that should appear due to the averaging procedure. 
In \citet{wang2008objective} they derive \ref{eq:hybrid_avg_dt_pp} by the means of kinetic theory, based on \ref{eq:jefferey} and the fact that $\ddt \textbf{p} = \omega_\alpha \times \textbf{p}$ (Equation (3) of their article).
Their equation is similar to \ref{eq:hybrid_avg_dt_pp} except that their employ a phenomenological closure for the term, $\div \mathbf{\Sigma}$, which account for particles interactions.
Anyhow, we showed how it is possible to derive the orientation tensor conservation equation, commonly used in fiber field theory, from the second-order moments of mass's equation. 
However, \ref{eq:jefferey} is valid in low inertial regime only. 

Therefore, it is indispensable to consider a more general framework when working with inertial particles. 
Thus, for instance we consider the equation for $\textbf{A}_p$, as, 
\begin{equation*}
    \pddt (n_p\textbf{A})
    + \div (
        n_p\textbf{u}_p\textbf{A}_p
        + \mathbf{\Sigma}
        )
    =
    n_p \textbf{A}_p \times \bm\omega_p
    + n_p \bm\omega_p \times \textbf{A}_p
    + \pavg{\textbf{pp} \times \bm\omega_\alpha'}
    + \pavg{\bm\omega_\alpha' \times \textbf{pp}},
    \label{eq:dt_Ap}
\end{equation*}
where the last two terms on the right-hand side corresponds to the covariance between orientation and rotation. 
The mean particle orientation tensor $\textbf{A}_p$ appearing on the right-hand side of \ref{eq:dt_Ap} are part of the unknown of the problem.
However, $\bm\omega_p$ is not, since we chose in this work to solve for the components of $\omega_p$ in the local basis. 
Using \ref{eq:omega_p_local} we deduce that two new closure terms appear in this equation namely $\textbf{p}_p^i$ and $\pavg{(\omega^i)' \textbf{p}^i}$. 
This makes the utility of solving $\bm\omega_\alpha$ in the particle's local basis doubtful. 
Unfortunately, further discussion on this closure problem is beyond the scope of this work, and we must therefore conclude the discussion on this point.

\subsection{Deformation, rate of strain and  equation}

In the small deformation regime, the aspect ratio is governed by \ref{eq:small_def}, and the particle rate of strain by  \ref{eq:lamb_like_model}. 
Therefore, the equations for $\chi_p$ and $E_p$ can be derived averaging the latter equations and reads,  
\begin{align}
    \pddt (n_p \chi_p)
    + \div (
        n_p \textbf{u}_p \chi_p 
        + \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' \chi_p'}
    )
    &= 2 n_p E_p,
    \label{eq:avg_chi_I}
    \\
    \pddt (n_p E_p)
    + \div (
        n_p \textbf{u}_p E_p 
        + \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' E_p'}
    )
    &= 
    - \frac{8 \gamma }{a^3\rho_d} n_p \chi_p
    - \frac{10 \mu_d}{a^2\rho_d} n_p E_p
    + \frac{10}{m_\alpha a^2} n_p F^{||}_p,
    \label{eq:avg_E_I}
\end{align}
respectively.
We recall that in principle, $\textbf{u}_p$ and $n_p$ are already known by solving the mass and momentum equation of the particle phase.
Thus, the only closure terms required by these equations is the covariance term $\pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' \chi_p'}$, $ \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' E_p'}$ and of course the forcing term project on the principal axis of the particle, namely $\pavg{\textbf{pp} : \textbf{F}} = n_p F_p^{||}$. 
Note that if we had considered the deformation and rate of strain equation in the laboratory reference frame this would represent two tensor equations instead of two scalar ones. 


To complete entirely this system of equation we may add three equations, one for each component of the angular velocity, $\omega_p^i$. 
This is done by averaging \ref{eq:dt_omega_I}, namely,
\begin{align*}
    \pddt (n_p \omega^i_p)
    + \div (
        n_p \textbf{u}_p \omega^i_p 
        + \pavg{\textbf{u}_\alpha' \omega^i_p}
    )
    = 
    % I^{ab}\omega^b  \omega^c \epsilon_{jki} p_i^a p_j^c p_k^a
    \frac{5}{2 m_\alpha a^2}\left[
        \omega^i_p E^i_p + \pavg{(\omega^i_\alpha)' E^i_p}
        +\pavg{
        \frac{2 \textbf{p}^i}{ (2 - \chi_I)}\cdot 
        \intS{(\textbf{r}\times\bm\sigma_f^0\cdot \textbf{n})} 
        }
    \right]. 
\end{align*}
The supplementary closure terms related to the local basis averaging is only $\pavg{(\omega^i_\alpha)' E^i_p}$.
Thus, notice how we drastically reduced the complexity of the equation by expressing it in the local reference frame instead of directly averaging \ref{eq:dt_mu2} which would yields complicated expression due to the presence of the inertia tensor inside the time derivative.  


Overall,  the equations for $E_p$ and $\chi_p$ are in fact relatively simple since they are scalars equations. 
The complicated matter on this problem is the orientation equation, in order to determine $\textbf{A}_p$ which riquire $\bm\omega_p$ in the laboratory reference frame. 
Nevertheless, we have shown how to derive equations of deformation together with angular momentum in the particle local reference frame. 
Even though it seems that we have reduced dramatically the number of equations it seems that we generated new closures and unknowns. 
Especially the particle deformation, rate of deformation and angular velocity the tensor still need the covariance term.
